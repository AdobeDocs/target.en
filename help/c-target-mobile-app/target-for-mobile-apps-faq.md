# Target for mobile apps FAQ

List of frequently asked questions about [!DNL Target] for mobile apps.

## Should I use [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] to deploy the SDK, or can I deploy the SDK without using [!DNL Launch]?

The SDK is available on the [Adobe Marketing Cloud git](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/). If you don't use [Launch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/overview.html), you must manage your own settings file and manage it in your app. 

## Which SDKs are available today?

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs currently support iOS, Android, and React. For more information, see the [Adobe Experience Cloud Platform Mobile SDKs guide](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/).

## What is the frequency of the location-based feature, in terms of verification about the latitude and longitude?

See the [Adobe Places documentation](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/) for more information.

## Do I need at.js for the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs to work?

No, you donâ€™t need at.js to use the mobile SDKs. at.js is the [!DNL Target] JavaScript library for websites. The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are for mobile apps.

## Is [!DNL Target] Mobile a functionality of Adobe [!DNL Target] Premium Product SKU only?

No. For [!DNL Adobe Target Standard] customers, you can use our Mobile SDKs for A/B Test and Experience Targeting (XT) activities only with the [!DNL Target Standard] Mobile App add-on. If you want to use Recommendations or AI-powered features in the mobile app, you need an [Adobe Target Premium](/help/c-intro/intro.md#premium) license.

## Is there a mobile app integration between Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and [!DNL Target] mobile activities?

It is on our roadmap but there is no timeline yet. Currently, you can share JSON [Experience Fragments](/help/c-experiences/c-manage-content/aem-experience-fragments.md) from AEM to Target and there might be potential to then use them in a mobile app activity.
