## Using experience fragments in [!DNL Target] activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the experience fragment displays on the [!UICONTROL Offers] page in [!DNL Target].

>[!NOTE]

>[!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The experience fragment is currently imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. Note that the experience fragment "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the experience fragment in [!DNL Target].

## Considerations {#considerations}

* [!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.
* The experience fragment is currently imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. Note that the experience fragment "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the experience fragment in [!DNL Target].
* You cannot create experience fragments using Adobe IO. You must create experience fragments using AEM, as explained above.
