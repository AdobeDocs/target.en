Note the following:

* For [!DNL at.js] implementations, [!DNL Target] displays default content in earlier versions of Internet Explorer and possibly in earlier versions of the above-listed browsers.
* Internet Explorer treats all unknown elements (such as custom elements) as the same element type. As a result, delivery does not work with custom elements.
* [!DNL Target] displays default content in browsers not listed above and in browsers using [quirks mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode). at.js requires a doctype that renders in standard mode, for example: `<!DOCTYPE html>` .
* Adobe Delivery infrastructure is being secured to NOT support TLS 1.0 devices and browsers after September 12, 2018. See [TLS (Transport Layer Security) Encryption Changes](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md#concept_CC1001E9D3AE4BABAF90B8311B0A6451) to understand the overall impact of this change.
