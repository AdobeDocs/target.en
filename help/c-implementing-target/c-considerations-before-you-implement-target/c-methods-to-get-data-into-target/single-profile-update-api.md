# Single profile update API

Almost identical to the Bulk Profile Update API, but one visitor profile is updated at a time, in line in the API call instead of with a .csv file.

## Format

The visitor must be identified via the Target mboxPC value or mboxThirdPartyId value. The Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is not supported.

## Example Use Cases

You want to update Target in real time when a visitor performs some offline action. Actions can include reaching a call center, a loan is funded, using a loyalty card in store, accessing a kiosk, and so forth.

## Benefits of method

No limit on the number of profile attributes.

Profile attributes sent via the site can be updated via the API and vice versa.

## Caveats

Limit of 1,000,000 API calls (1 million) per 24-hour period

Updates profiles only. Cannot create a profile for a potential user Target has yet to see.

## Code examples

GET and POST supported. `https://CLIENT.tt.omtrdc.net/m2/client/profile/update?mboxPC=1368007744041-575948.01_00&profile.attr1=0&profile.attr2=1...`
