# Transition from [!DNL Target] legacy APIs to Adobe I/O

Information to help you use transition from the Target legacy APIs to the new APIs on Adobe I/O.

With the decommissioning of Adobe Target Classic, the APIs that are connected to your Target Classic account have also been made unavailable. This document will help you transition your legacy API-based integrations to the Target APIs powered by Adobe I/O.

For more information about the Target API documentation, see [Target APIs and NodeJS SDK](/help/c-implementing-target/c-api-and-sdk-overview/api-and-sdk-overview.md#concept_5718EC1FF2ED4436935D0BCCD7AA29A6).

## Terminology {#section_D8286EDAE3B24D208DA432AEF2E88FD9}

| Term | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Legacy API|APIs that are linked to your Target Classic account. These API calls are based on a username and password-based authentication and use the hostname `testandtarget.omniture.com`. If your API calls contain a user name and password in the request URL, you must transition to Adobe I/O APIs.|
|Adobe I/O|Adobe I/O is the new gateway for Target APIs. These APIs are connected to your Target Standard/Premium account. The Target APIs on Adobe I/O use a JWT-based authentication, which is the industry standard for secure enterprise APIs.|

## Timeline {#section_A478EBF637554A2DB5A31661955121ED}

The legacy APIs will be decommissioned when you Target Classic is decommissioned:

| Date | Details |
|--- |--- |
|October 17, 2017|All API methods that perform a write operation (`saveCampaign`, `copyCampaign`, `saveHTMLOfferContent`, and `setCampaignState`) were decommissioned.<br>This is the same date when all Target Classic user accounts were set to read-only status.|
|November 14, 2017|The remaining APIs were decommissioned. This is the date when the Target Classic user interface was decommissioned|

Recommendations Classic APIs won’t be impacted by this time line.

## Equivalent Methods {#section_DDB42CCC172545B09CB728D794CC466B}

The following table lists the equivalent new Target API methods for the legacy API methods. The new APIs return JSON when compared to the XML response provided by the legacy APIs.

The new API methods are linked to the corresponding section in the API documentation site. An example is provided for each API method. You can also use the Admin Postman Collection that contains sample API calls for all the new Adobe API methods on Adobe I/O.
