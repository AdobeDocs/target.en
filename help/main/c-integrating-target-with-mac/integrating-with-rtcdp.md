## Share Real-time CDP Profile Attributes with [!DNL Target] {#rtcdp-profile-attributes}

Real-time CDP Profile Attributes can be shared with [!DNL Target] for use in HTML offers and [JSON offers](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/create-json-offer.md). 

### Real-time CDP Profile Attributes feature limitations and considerations

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Real-time CDP Profile Attributes feature is currently available in Beta for HTML Offers and [JSON Offers](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/create-json-offer.md).

Consider the following:

* Attributes within a given offer must be from the same AEP Sandbox. (In other words, an offer cannot contain attributes from different AEP Sandboxes.)
* Attributes within a given offer can come from different Sources; namely, the [!DNL Target] profile and the AEP profile. (In other words, you can combine attributes whether they come from [!DNL Target] or from the AEP profile.)
* When defining an offer, you can assign default values for Real-time CDP Profile Attributes, in case the attribute does not have an explicit value. For example, if a consent or governance policy blocks the attribute being used in the personalization service, the default value can be used instead.
* When shared, Real-time CDP Profile Attributes are used in the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning personalization models for [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] and [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activities.

### Sample use case

As an online marketer, you want the AEP/Unified Profile to share attribute values with [!DNL Target] in order to provide real-time personalization. By using Real-time CDP Profile Attributes, you can display the value of the AEP attribute in a [!DNL Target] offer using token replace. For example, you can personalize according to a customer's favorite color using `${aep.profile.favoriteColor}`, or their loyalty tier and loyalty point value using the tokens `${aep.loyalty.tier}` and `${aep.loyalty.points}`.

Note that assigning default values is optional.
