## Use audiences from [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] {#aep}

Using [audiences](/help/main/c-target/c-audiences/audiences.md) created in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] provide richer customer data that leads to more impactful personalization. The [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html){target=_blank} (RTCDP), built on [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], helps companies bring together known and anonymous data from multiple enterprise sources. This process lets you create customer profiles that can be used to provide personalized customer experiences across all channels and devices in real time.

By connecting [!DNL Target] to the [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform], customers can enrich their web personalization. This integration lets you unlock new segments that might have been previously inaccessible to [!DNL Target] to enable real-time millisecond personalization on the first page of a customer's web visit. Using audiences and profile attributes created in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] lets you expand the available data points for richer personalization. 

This integration unlocks key use cases with Real-Time CDP:

* Same-page / Next Hit personalization
* First-time / Unknown users personalization

## Share Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes with [!DNL Target] {#rtcdp-profile-attributes}

Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes can be shared with [!DNL Target] for use in HTML offers and [JSON offers](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/create-json-offer.md). 

### Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes feature limitations and considerations 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes feature is available in Beta for HTML Offers and [JSON Offers](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/create-json-offer.md).

Consider the following:

* Attributes within a given offer must be from the same [!UICONTROL Experience Platform] sandbox. (In other words, an offer cannot contain attributes from different [!UICONTROL Experience Platform] sandboxes.)
* Attributes within a given offer can come from different sources; namely, the [!DNL Target] profile and the [!UICONTROL Experience Platform] profile. (In other words, you can combine attributes whether they come from [!DNL Target] or from the [!UICONTROL Experience Platform] profile.)
* When defining an offer, you can assign default values for [!UICONTROL Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes], in case the attribute does not have an explicit value. For example, if a consent or governance policy blocks the attribute being used in the personalization service, the default value can be used instead.

### JSON sample use case

As an online marketer, you want the AEP/Unified Profile to share attribute values with [!DNL Target] to provide real-time personalization. By using [!UICONTROL Real-Time CDP Profile Attributes], you can display the value of the [!UICONTROL Experience Platform] attribute in a [!DNL Target] offer using token replace. For example, you can personalize according to a customer's favorite color using `${aep.profile.favoriteColor}`, or their loyalty tier and loyalty point value using the tokens `${aep.loyalty.tier}` and `${aep.loyalty.points}`.

To create a JSON offer to share AEP/Unified Profile attributes with [!DNL Target]:

1. While [creating a JSON offer](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/create-json-offer.md), from the **[!UICONTROL Select a source]** list, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]**.
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Select a profile sandbox name]** list, select the desired sandbox.
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Select a profile attribute]** list, select the desired attributes.
1. (Optional) From the **[!UICONTROL Insert a default value]** list, select the desired values.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

The following illustration shows that two profile attributes: `loyalty.tier` and `loyalty.points` have been added to the JSON offer.
