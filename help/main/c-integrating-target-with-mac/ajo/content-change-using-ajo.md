1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Campaign]** in the upper right corner of the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] page.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Scheduled - Marketing]** (the default), then click **Create** to display the [!UICONTROL Campaign] details page.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** section, provide a descriptive name and optional description for the campaign.
