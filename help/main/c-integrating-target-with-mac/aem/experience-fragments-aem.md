## Using [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] in [!DNL Target] activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] displays on the [!UICONTROL Offers] page in [!DNL Target].

[!DNL Target] currently looks for [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] to import every ten minutes. The imported [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.

The [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] is imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML or JSON offer. The [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] in [!DNL Target].

You can filter and search by [!UICONTROL HTML XFs] and [!UICONTROL JSON XFs] to help you distinguish between [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] types that are exported to [!DNL Target].

![Filter by Experience Fragment types: HTML or JSON in the Target UI](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/fragment-types.png)

You can hover over an [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] in the list, then click the [!UICONTROL View] icon ![Info icon](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/icon-info.png) to see additional information about the [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment], including its [!UICONTROL Name], [!UICONTROL Type], [!UICONTROL Offer ID], [!UICONTROL Offer path], and last modifications information. Click the [!UICONTROL Offer Usage] tab to see the activities that reference this offer.

![Experience Fragment information pop-up](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/xf-info-popup.png)

You can consume [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] in [!DNL Target] activities using the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md) (VEC) and the [Form-Based Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md).


>[!TIP]

>* To fully use the [!DNL Target] AI and ML functionality, you can select [Auto-Allocate](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md#concept_A1407678796B4C569E94CBA8A9F7F5D4) or [Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md) while creating an  activity.
>
>* [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] are not supported in [!DNL Recommendations] activities. However, to use [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] for recommendations you can create an [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activity (including [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target]) or an [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activity and [include recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). 

**To consume [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] using the VEC:**

1. In [!DNL Target], while creating or editing an experience in the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/experiences.md#concept_A2E10F6AFB3D4AEAB6951EE14688848D), click the location on the page where you want to insert [!DNL AEM] content, then select the desired option to display the [!UICONTROL Choose an Experience Fragment] list.

   * [!UICONTROL Insert Before]
   * [!UICONTROL Insert After]
   * [!UICONTROL Swap with Experience Fragment]

   The [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] list displays the content created in [!DNL AEM] that is now natively available from within [!DNL Target].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL Swap with Experience Fragment] option is not available for images. If you want to use this option with an image, click the container element that contains the desired image.

If you want to use JSON [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments], use them in activities created using the [Form-based experience composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md).

**To consume [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] using the [!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer]:**

1. In [!DNL Target], while creating or editing an experience in the [Form-Based Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md#task_FAC842A6535045B68B4C1AD3E657E56E), select the location on the page where you want to insert [!DNL AEM] content, then select **[!UICONTROL Change Experience Fragment]** to display the [!UICONTROL Choose an Experience Fragment] list.

## Removing ClientLibs and extraneous HTML from [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] exported to [!UICONTROL Target]

When using [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] offers with [!DNL Target] on a page delivered by AEM, the targeted page already contains all of the necessary Client Libraries. Note also that extraneous HTML elements in the offer are also not necessary.

Sometimes entire HTML pages wrap the [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] and cause problems. Ensure that the [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] is a small piece of HTML and not a full HTML page with HTML, HEAD, BODY, and so forth.
