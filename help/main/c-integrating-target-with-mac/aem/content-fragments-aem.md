## Using [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] in [!DNL Target] activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] displays on the [!UICONTROL Offers] page in [!DNL Target].

[!DNL Target] currently looks for [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] to import every ten minutes. The imported [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.

The [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] is imported into [!DNL Target] as a JSON offer. That [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] in [!DNL Target].

You can filter and search by [!UICONTROL HTML XFs], [!UICONTROL JSON XFs], and [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] to help you distinguish between different offers types that are exported to [!DNL Target].

![Filter by Content Fragment types: HTML or JSON in the Target UI](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/fragment-types.png)

You can hover over a [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] in the list, then click the [!UICONTROL View] icon ![Info icon](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/icon-info.png) to see additional information about the [!UICONTROL Content Fragment], including its [!UICONTROL AEM path] and [!UICONTROL AEM deep link]. Click the [!UICONTROL Offer Usage] tab to see the activities that reference this offer.

![Content Fragment information pop-up](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/cf-info-popup.png)

You can consume [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] in [!DNL Target] activities using the [Form-Based Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md) only. You *cannot* consume [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] in [!DNL Target] activities using the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md) (VEC). [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] are exported as JSON in [!DNL Target] and cannot be used in activities created using the VEC.

>[!TIP]
>
>Use Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and recommendations with [!UICONTROL Content Fragments]:
>
>* To fully use the [!DNL Target] AI and ML functionality, you can select [Auto-Allocate](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md#concept_A1407678796B4C569E94CBA8A9F7F5D4) or [Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md) while creating an A/B Test.
>
>* [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] are not supported in [!DNL Recommendations] activities. However, to use [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] for recommendations you can create an [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activity (including [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target]) or an [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activity and [include recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). 

**To consume [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] using the [!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer]:**

1. In [!DNL Target], while creating or editing an experience in the [Form-Based Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md#task_FAC842A6535045B68B4C1AD3E657E56E), select the location on the page where you want to insert [!DNL AEM] content, then select **[!UICONTROL Change Content Fragment]** to display the [!UICONTROL Choose a Content Fragment] list.

   ![content_fragment_list image](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/aem/assets/choose-content-fragment.png)

   The [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] list displays the content created in [!DNL AEM] that is now natively available from within [!DNL Target]. 

1. Select the desired [!UICONTROL Content Fragment], then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 
1. Finish configuring the activity.

## Considerations {#considerations}

* [!DNL Target] currently looks for [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] to import every ten minutes. The imported [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.
* The [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] is imported into [!DNL Target] as a JSON offer. The [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] in [!DNL Target].
* You cannot create [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] using [!DNL Adobe I/O]. Create [!UICONTROL Content Fragments] using AEM, as explained above.
* If you update your [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] in AEM, the [!UICONTROL Content Fragment] must be published and exported to [!DNL Target] again so [!DNL Target] can use the latest changes.
