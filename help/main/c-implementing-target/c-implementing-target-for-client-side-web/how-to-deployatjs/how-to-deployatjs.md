# How to deploy at.js

Information about how to deploy the [!DNL Adobe Target] JavaScript library, at.js, using tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] or without a tag manager.

You can deploy at.js using the following methods:

* **[Implement [!DNL Target] using tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/implement-target-using-adobe-launch/){target=_blank}**: Tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] are the next generation of tag management capabilities from [!DNL Adobe]. Tags give customers a simple way to deploy and manage the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/term-updates.html?lang=en) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

* **[Implement Target without a Tag Manager](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/implement-target-without-a-tag-manager/){target=_blank}**: You can implement Target without using a tag manager (for example, tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]).
* **Implement Target using a third-party tag manager**: [Tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/implement-target-using-adobe-launch/){target=_blank} is the preferred method to implement Target; however, you can also implement Target using a third-party tag manager, including Tealium, Ensighten, and Google Tag. For a list of benefits of using Launch, see [Advantages of implementing at.js using the [!DNL Adobe Target] extension](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/implement-target-using-adobe-launch/){target=_blank}.

  However, if you know how to implement [!DNL Target] without a tag manager you can easily implement with a third-party tag manager instead of hard-coding at.js in the site code.

  Here are two relevant topics that will help you implement [!DNL Target] with a third-party tag manager:

  * [Before you implement](https://developer.adobe.com/target/before-implement/)
  * [Implement [!DNL Target] without a tag manager](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/implement-target-without-a-tag-manager/)

  Be sure to check the documentation for your third-party tag manager for more information.

To implement [!DNL Target] when using Single Page Apps (SPAs), see [Single Page Application implementation](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-to-deployatjs/target-atjs-single-page-application/){target=_blank}.
