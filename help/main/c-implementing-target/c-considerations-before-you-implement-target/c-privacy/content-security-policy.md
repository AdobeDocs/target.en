# Content Security Policy (CSP) directives

If you are using [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) (CSP) for your [!DNL Adobe Target] implementation, you should add the following CSP directives when using [at.js 2.1 or later](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/target-atjs-versions/){target=_blank}:

* `connect-src` with `*.tt.omtrdc.net` allowlisted. Necessary to allow the network request to the [!DNL Target] edge.
* `style-src unsafe-inline`. Required for pre-hiding and flicker control.
* `script-src unsafe-inline`.  Required to allow JavaScript execution that might be part of an HTML offer.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Consult the following FAQs about security policies:

### Do Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Flash Cross-domain policies present security issues?

The recommended way of implementing the CORS policy is to permit access to only trusted origins that require it via an allowlist of trusted domains. The same can be said for the Flash Cross-domain policy. Some [!DNL Adobe Target] customers are concerned about the use of wildcard characters for domains in [!DNL Target]. The concern is that If a user is logged in to an application, and visits a domain allowed by the policy, any malicious content running on that domain can potentially retrieve sensitive content from the application and carry out actions within the security context of the logged in user. This is commonly referred to as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

In an [!DNL Adobe Target] implementation, however, these policies should not represent a security issue.

"adobe.tt.omtrdc.net" is an Adobe-owned domain. [!DNL Adobe Target] is a testing and personalization tool and it is expected that [!DNL Target] can receive and process requests from anywhere without requiring any authentication. These requests contain key/value pairs that are used for A/B testing, recommendations, or content personalization.

[!DNL Adobe] does not store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive information on [!DNL Adobe Target] edge servers, to which "adobe.tt.omtrdc.net" points.

It is expected that [!DNL Target] can be accessed from any domain via JavaScript calls. The only way to allow this access is by leveraging "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" with a wildcard.
