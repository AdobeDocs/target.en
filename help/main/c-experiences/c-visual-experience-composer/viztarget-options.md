# Visual Experience Composer options

The [!DNL Adobe Target Standard/Premium] 25.2.1 release (February 12, 2015) introduces an updated [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC). This article explains the updated UI and its options.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>The updated [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Composer] requires the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] [[!UICONTROL Visual Editing Helper] extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md) available on the Chrome Web Store.

The VEC displays when you create or edit an existing activity.

<!--When you hover over the DOM path, a blue box highlights the corresponding element in the VEC. When you click the element, an orange box highlights the element and the VEC options menu displays, as explained above.-->

You can easily navigate to any parent, sibling, or child element within the VEC using the DOM path.

### [!UICONTROL Image], [!UICONTROL HTML], and [!UICONTROL Text]

Add any kind of element to your page in addition to modifying existing content. Add text, code, lists, and more to create entirely different experiences to test.

Select an element on the page, then click [!UICONTROL Insert Before] and choose whether you want to insert an image, HTML, or text. The inserted element appears before the selected element.

The behavior of the inserted element depends on the structure of your page, your CSS, and other page configuration options. Valid HTML is required to make your page appear correctly. Always test your page after inserting an item to make sure it appears as expected.

[!UICONTROL Recommendations] supports [!UICONTROL Insert Before] the contents of DIV, SECTION, and ARTICLE tags.

**Note:** Inserting an image requires that [!DNL Adobe Scene7 Publishing System] is enabled so you have access to the image library.

For more information, see [Use offer decisions](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/ajo/offer-decision.md).

### [!UICONTROL Image]

Select a different image from the Content Library. The images available for swapping include the images uploaded to the Experience Cloud assets folder or uploaded in the Content Library in Target.

During initial activity creation, the URL displayed is not the URL used for delivery. Upon activity synching, that URL is updated to a production Scene7 URL.

For example, the initial URL might look like the following example:

`https://test.marketing.adobe.com/content/dam/mac/scholasticinc/Aug_MBM.jpeg?ch_ck=1470774943867`

After activity syncing, the delivery URL might look like the following example:

`http://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TargetTest/Aug_MBM?tm=1470768352933&fit=constrain&hei=173&wid=300`

Recommendations supports Replace With in DIV, SECTION, and ARTICLE tags.

**Note:** Swapping images requires an Adobe Scene7 Publishing System Account.

### [!UICONTROL HTML Offer]

Select a different offer from the [!UICONTROL Content Library].

**Note:** HTML Offers are stored on [!DNL Target] servers.

An HTML offer can be up to 256 KB.

### Recommendation

Include recommendations inside A/B Test (including Auto-Allocate and Auto-Target) and Experience Targeting (XT) activities. For more information, see [Recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md).

### [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment]

## [!UICONTROL Layout]

The following options are available:

### [!UICONTROL Rearrange]

Drag the element to another location inside the same parent element or DIV. Other elements shift location to make space for the rearranged element.

**Note**: Click-tracking does not work on rearranged items.

Currently, certain VEC actions, such as [!UICONTROL Rearrange] and [!UICONTROL Move], assume that the sibling elements of the source and destination parent elements are completely loaded. If lazy loading occurs under the parent DOM elements (source or destination), these VEC actions can cause inconsistent behavior. We are working on a more reliable approach to make VEC actions work in lazy-loaded DOM elements. As a temporary workaround, you can use [!UICONTROL Custom Code] in these scenarios to render your experiences.

### [!UICONTROL Resize]

Resize an element on your page. When you select [!UICONTROL Resize], a handle appears in the bottom-right corner of the element that lets you drag that corner to resize. Hold the Shift key to retain the same aspect ratio.

**Note:** Inline elements cannot be resized.

### [!UICONTROL Move] {#move}

Move elements on your page. Unlike the [!UICONTROL Rearrange] option, [!UICONTROL Move] does not shift other elements to make room for the element being moved. Use the arrow keys to fine tune the move. (Planned enhancement: support to ensure moved elements are not hidden behind other elements.)

In certain situations, such as when a CSS restriction requires an element to remain inside its parent element, you cannot move the element outside its parent. An element cannot be moved outside of a container that has following CSS property: `overflow: hidden`.

See [!UICONTROL Rearrange] above for more information about inconsistent behavior with the [!UICONTROL Move] and [!UICONTROL Rearrange] actions due to lazy loading of DOM elements.

### [!UICONTROL Hide]

Hide the element. The white space remains, but the content is removed.

### [!UICONTROL Remove]

Remove the element. The white space behind the image is removed and the space where the element was is collapsed.

**Note:** Items within a "classic" mbox (an mbox created within a Target Classic campaign) cannot be removed using this option.

## [!UICONTROL Expand Section]

Select the parent element in addition to the originally selected element. When you select any parent element, all children of that element are automatically selected. You can expand the selection multiple times.

## [!UICONTROL Navigate to Link]

Open the destination of the link.

## [!UICONTROL Undo]/[!UICONTROL Redo]

Undo changes you make to your activities during an editing session. You can also redo changes that have been previously undone.

## Considerations {#considerations}

* If an offer contains HTML content, see "How at.js renders offers with HTML content" in [How at.js works](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target-dev/developer/client-side/at-js-implementation/at-js/how-atjs-works.html){target=_blank} for more information.

## Custom element support {#custom}

The VEC supports [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) to let you create and test personalized experiences and offers on custom elements and on elements inside custom elements. This functionality is available in the VEC for all [!DNL Target] activity types.

>[!NOTE]
>
>VEC support for custom elements is supported in [at.js version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target-dev/developer/client-side/at-js-implementation/target-atjs-versions.html){target=_blank} 2.7.0 (or later){target=_blank}. Ensure that your website has the required version deployed. If you are using the [Visual Experience Composer helper extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/vec-helper-browser-extension.md), it must also have the required version of at.js deployed. The VEC options described above are not visible and available for use with non-supported versions of at.js.
>
>VEC support for custom elements is currently not supported with the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target-dev/developer/client-side/aep-web-sdk.html){target=_blank}.

Most VEC actions are supported on custom events and inside custom events, with the following exceptions: 

The following actions are not available on custom elements:

* [!UICONTROL Edit]
  * [!UICONTROL Text/HTML]
  * [!UICONTROL Link]
  * [!UICONTROL Edit Source]

* [!UICONTROL Replace Content]

The following action is not available inside custom elements:

* [!UICONTROL Layout]
  * [!UICONTROL Rearrange]-->
