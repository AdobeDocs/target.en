# [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] changes

The [!DNL Adobe Target Standard/Premium] 25.2.1 release (February 11, 2015) introduces an updated [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC). This article explains the differences between the previous and updated versions of the VEC.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The updated [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Composer] requires the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] [[!UICONTROL Visual Editing Helper] extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md) available on Chrome Web Store.

The VEC displays when you create or edit an existing activity.

## Major changes to the VEC

The following sections explain the major changes in the updated VEC compared to the previous version.

### [!UICONTROL Experiences] panel

Like in the previous version, the [!UICONTROL Experiences] panel remains on the left side of the VEC. The [!UICONTROL Experiences] panel cannot be collapsed.

![Experiences panel](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/experiences-panel.png)

You can create, rename or remove experiences using the [!UICONTROL Experiences] panel. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** icon ( ![Add icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Add.svg) ) to add a new experience. Click the [!UICONTROL More Actions] icon ( ![More Actions icon](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreSmall.svg) ) to duplicate, delete, or redirect an experience.

### [!UICONTROL Components] panel (new)

You can add a number of components to your web page and edit them needed by using the new [!UICONTROL Components] panel.

![Components panel](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/components-panel.png)

To add a new component, drag the component you want to insert over an existing page element in the editing canvas. Then choose to insert the component before of after the selected element. 

As compared to the previous VEC version, you cannot replace a selected element with a component.

### [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel

To open the [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel, click the [!UICONTROL Show Modifications] icon ( ![Show Modifiations panel](/help/main/assets/icons/History.svg) ) in the [!UICONTROL Components] panel. The [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel changed position from right side to left side of the editing canvas.

![Modifications panel](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/modifications-panel.png)

The [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel shows all changes that have been made to your page in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) and lets you make additional changes (such as CSS Selector, Mbox, and Custom Code).

Click the [!UICONTROL More Options] icon ( ![More Actions icon](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreSmall.svg) ) to add a modification, delete all modifications, or delete all invalid modifications. Click [!UICONTROL Select] to perform bulk operations: [!UICONTROL Apply to All Pages] or [!UICONTROL Delete]. 

### [!UICONTROL Properties] panel (new)

The new [!UICONTROL Properties] panel lets you change properties of selected elements on the page, whether these elements are HTML elements or objects specific to [!DNL Target], such as recommendations or offers.

![Properties panel](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/properties-panel.png)

Click the icons on top of the panel to edit HTML code or delete, duplicate, or hide elements. Changes appear in the [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel.

The [!UICONTROL Properties] panel is collapsible in the right rail. Click the [!UICONTROL Show/Hide Properties] icon ( ![Properties icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Propertie.svg) ) to the right of the panel to collapse or display the [!UICONTROL Properties] panel.

### Activity settings/configuration

Click the [!UICONTROL Configure] icon ( ![Configure icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Setting.svg) ) displayed on top of the design canvas to display the activity properties menu.

![Activity configurations options](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/configure-options.png)

The different options let you enable or disable multi-page or multiple audience activities, assign properties ([[!DNL Target Premium]](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium) feature), or edit page delivery rules. 

The position and functionality is similar to the previous VEC UI.

### [!UICONTROL Design]/[!UICONTROL Browse] modes

Use the [!UICONTROL Design]/[!UICONTROL Browse] toggles displayed on top of the design canvas to switch between design and browse mode.

![Design and browse toggles](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/design-browse-mode.png)

Use the [!UICONTROL Browse] mode to navigate your site and to pick the view or page you want to update. Switch back to [!UICONTROL Design] mode to add or edit your changes.

### [!UICONTROL Undo]/[!UICONTROL Redo]

You can undo changes made by clicking the [!UICONTROL Undo] icon ( ![Undo icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Undo.svg) ). 

![Undo icon in VEC](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/undo.png)

To redo an action, expand the [!UICONTROL ]Undo/[!UICONTROL Redo] button group and choose [!UICONTROL Redo].

### [!UICONTROL Design] canvas

The [!UICONTROL Design] canvas lets you select viewports, including fit-to screen, [!UICONTROL Desktop], [!UICONTROL Tablet], [!UICONTROL Mobile Landscape], and [!UICONTROL Mobile Portrait]. By default, the canvas fits the page to the screen along with the viewports defined in the [Administration](/help/main/administrating-target/visual-experience-composer-set-up.md) section.

![Viewport options](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/assets/viewports.png)

The updated VEC also lets you zoom in or zoom out by clicking the appropriate icon ( ![Zoom In icon](/help/main/assets/icons/ZoomIn.svg) or ![Zoom Out icon](/help/main/assets/icons/ZoomOut.svg) ).
