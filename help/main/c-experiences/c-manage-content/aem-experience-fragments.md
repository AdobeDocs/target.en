## Using experience fragments in [!DNL Target] activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the experience fragment displays on the [!UICONTROL Offers] page in [!DNL Target].

>[!NOTE]
>
>* [!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.
>
>* The experience fragment is imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. That experience fragment "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the experience fragment in [!DNL Target].

You can hover over an experience fragment in the list, then click the [!UICONTROL View] icon ![View icon](assets/icon_info.png) to see additional information about the experience fragment, including its public offer delivery URL and its [!DNL AEM] path.

You can consume experience fragments in [!DNL Target] activities using the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md) (VEC) or the [Form-Based Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>To fully use the [!DNL Target] AI and ML functionality, you can select [Auto-Allocate](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md#concept_A1407678796B4C569E94CBA8A9F7F5D4) or [Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md) while creating an A/B Test.
>
>Experience fragments are not supported in [!DNL Recommendations] activities. However, to use experience fragments for recommendations you can create an [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activity (including [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target]) or an [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activity and [include recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-experiences/c-manage-content/aem-experience-fragments.md). 

**To consume experience fragments using the VEC:**

1. In [!DNL Target], while creating or editing an experience in the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/main/c-experiences/experiences.md#concept_A2E10F6AFB3D4AEAB6951EE14688848D), click the location on the page where you want to insert [!DNL AEM] content, then select the desired option to display the [!UICONTROL Choose an Experience Fragment] list.

   * [!UICONTROL Insert Before]
   * [!UICONTROL Insert After]
   * [!UICONTROL Swap with Experience Fragment]

   The [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] list displays the content created in [!DNL AEM] that is now natively available from within [!DNL Target].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL Swap with Experience Fragment] option is not available for images. If you want to use this option with an image, click the container element that contains the desired image.

   ![](assets/experience_fragment_list.png)

## Considerations {#considerations}

* [!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.
* The experience fragment is imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. The experience fragment "primary" version remains in [!DNL AEM]. You cannot edit the experience fragment in [!DNL Target].
* You cannot create experience fragments using [!DNL Adobe I/O]. Create experience fragments using AEM, as explained above.
* If you update your experience fragment in AEM, the experience fragment must be published and exported to [!DNL Target] again so [!DNL Target] can use the latest changes.

## Removing ClientLibs and extraneous HTML from Experience Fragments exported to Target

When using experience fragment offers with [!DNL Target] on a page delivered by AEM, the targeted page already contains all of the necessary Client Libraries. Note also that extraneous HTML elements in the offer are also not necessary.

Sometimes entire HTML pages wrap the experience fragment and cause problems. Ensure that the experience fragment is a small piece of HTML and not a full HTML page with HTML, HEAD, BODY, and so forth.

For more information, see the following blog post: [AEM 6.5: Removing ClientLibs from Experience Fragments exported to Target](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/aem-65-removing-clientlibs-from-experience-fragments-exported-haser){target=_blank}.
