# Offers

Use the [!UICONTROL Offers] library in [!DNL Adobe Target] to manage your code offer and image offer content.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This article contains information about updates to the [!DNL Target] user interface that is currently part of a Beta program. The [!DNL Adobe Target] team often enables new features for select customers for testing and feedback purposes. After the testing period completes, these features are enabled for all customers in future [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] releases and announced in release notes.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Offers]** to open the library.

   The library contains the offers that have been set up via [!DNL Target Standard/Premium], [!DNL Target Classic], [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (AEM), [!DNL Adobe Mobile Services] (AMS), and APIs. Offers created in [!DNL Target Classic] or other solutions are editable in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium].

   The [!UICONTROL Offers] page has two tabs along the right side: [!UICONTROL Code Offers] and [!UICONTROL Image Offers] that let you view offers by type.

## Viewing offer definitions {#section_6B059DD121434E6292CAB393507D010E}

You can view offer definition details on a pop-up card in the [!UICONTROL Offers] library without opening the offer.

For example, the following offer definition card for an HTML offer is accessed by hovering over an offer on the [!UICONTROL Content] list, then clicking the information icon:
