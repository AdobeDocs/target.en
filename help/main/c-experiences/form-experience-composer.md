# Form-Based Experience Composer

The [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] is a non-visual experience and offer creation interface that's useful in creating experiences for use in [!UICONTROL A/B Test], [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting], [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization], and [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities when the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) is not available or practical for use. For example, you might use the Form-Based Experience Composer to create experiences and offers for delivery in emails, kiosks, and voice assistants.

If you are creating a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activity, there are no experiences. Choose your criteria and design. If you choose multiple criteria or designs, [!UICONTROL Target] automatically generates the experiences. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Activity]**, then select the type of activity you want to create.

   The [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] is available for [!UICONTROL A/B Test], [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting], [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization], and [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Form]** from the [!UICONTROL Create Activity] dialog box.

1. (Conditional) If you are a [Target Premium customer](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium), from the **[!UICONTROL Choose Workspace]** drop-down list, choose a [workspace](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md).

   The [[!UICONTROL Choose Workplace]](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md) option is a [Target Premium](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md) feature and might not display if your organization has a [!UICONTROL Target Standard] license.

1. Choose a property.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

   The [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] opens.

   This screen is different if you are creating a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activity. [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities do not include experiences.

1. 1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Rename]** icon ( ![Rename icon](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreSmallListVert.svg) ), click **[!UICONTROL Rename]**, specify a name for the activity, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   The activity name cannot begin with any of the following characters:

   | Character | Description |
   |--- |--- |
   |`=`|Equals to|
   |`+`|Plus|
   |`-`|Minus|
   |`@`|At sign|

   The activity name cannot contain any of the following character sequences:

   | Character Sequence | Description |
   |--- |--- |
   |;=|Semicolon, Equals to|
   |;+|Semicolon, Plus|
   |;-|Semicolon, Minus|
   |;@|Semicolon, At sign|
   |,=|Comma, Equals to|
   |,+|Comma, Plus|
   |,-|Comma, Minus|
   |,@|Comma, At sign|
   |`[`"|Open square bracket, Double quotation marks|
   |"`]`|Double quotation marks, Close square bracket|

1. Select a location.

   When you click in the [!UICONTROL Select Location] box, a list of available locations appears. Select one of those locations.

   You can also enter a location that is not listed here. This can be useful if the mbox has not yet been created or viewed on a page. Type the name of the location. Be careful when entering a location that does not yet exist. If the spelling or capitalization does not match the spelling and capitalization when the mbox call is made, the activity will not deliver. Manually entered locations are saved to the list of available locations. The next time you try to select a manually entered location, it will be available from the [!UICONTROL Select Location] drop-down list for that activity.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Creating a manually entered location during activity creation does not automatically create a new location. The location name is saved only in the context of the activity. The location is created when there is a content delivery call. Subsequent to the location being created, it will be available for use in other activities, for creating audiences, etc. from the drop-down list of available locations.
   
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Audience Refinements]**, choose one or more [audience](/help/main/c-target/target.md#concept_A782F8481A5041EBA75103CB26376522) for this activity, then click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

   In the [!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer], refinements have been replaced with full audience functionality. Refinements for existing activities have been migrated to [activity-only audiences](/help/main/c-target/creating-activity-only-audience.md#concept_A6BADCF530ED4AE1852E677FEBE68483).
