>February 23, 2023: The [!DNL Target] team is currently updating the NAT gateway addresses for downloading [!DNL Recommendations] feeds. If you implement IP allowlisting, ensure that you allowlist the following new AWS hosts. The existing hosts are scheduled to be decommissioned in the future. All nine hosts are now operational. 

[!DNL Target] [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities use the following AWS hosts when accessing customers' FTP servers:

**New hosts**:

| Location | Host |
| --- | --- |
| Oregon | `52.40.124.129` |
| Oregon | `54.148.219.69` |
| Oregon | `54.189.208.212` |
| Oregon | `44.230.236.35` |
| Oregon | `54.190.78.243` |
| Oregon | `52.41.73.133` |

**Existing hosts**:

| Location | Host |
| --- | --- |
| Oregon | `44.241.237.28` |
| Oregon | `44.232.167.82` |
| Oregon | `52.41.252.205` |

[!DNL Target] [!UICONTROL Recommendations] APIs also use the same AWS hosts.
