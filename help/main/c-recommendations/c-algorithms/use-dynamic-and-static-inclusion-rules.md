# Use dynamic and static inclusion rules

Create inclusion rules for criteria and promotions in [!DNL Adobe Target] and add dynamic or static filtering rules to achieve better results for your recommendations.

The process for creating and using inclusion rules for criteria and promotions is similar, as are the use cases and examples. Both criteria and promotions and the use of inclusion rules are covered in this section.

## Add filtering rules to criteria and promotions {#section_CD0D74B8D3BE4A75A78C36CF24A8C57F}

The following sections contain more information:

### Add filtering rules to criteria

1. While [creating criteria](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/create-new-algorithm.md#task_8A9CB465F28D44899F69F38AD27352FE) (**[!UICONTROL Recommendations] > [!UICONTROL Criteria] > [!UICONTROL Create Criteria] > [!UICONTROL Create Criteria]**), click **[!UICONTROL Add Filtering Rule]** under **[!UICONTROL Inclusion Rules]**.

   ![Add Filtering Rule](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/assets/add-fitering-rule.png)

1. Click the **Static Filter**  drop-down list in the "What other rules should the recommendation obey" box, then choose the desired option from the [!UICONTROL Static Filter] drop-down list.

   ![Static Filter drop-down list](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/assets/dynamic-and-static.png)

   The available options vary depending on the selected industry vertical and recommendation key.

### Add filtering rules to promotions

1. While [creating a promotion](/help/main/c-recommendations/t-create-recs-activity/adding-promotions.md#task_CC5BD28C364742218C1ACAF0D45E0E14), select **[!UICONTROL Promote by Attribute]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Add Filtering Rule]**.

## Filter Types {#section_0125F1ED10A84C0EB45325122460EBCD}

The following sections list the types of filtering options for [!UICONTROL Dynamic Filtering] and [!UICONTROL Filter by Value] for both criteria and promotions:

### Dynamic Filtering

Dynamic inclusion rules are more powerful than static inclusion rules and they yield better results and engagement. Consider the following:

* Dynamic inclusion rules deliver recommendations by matching an attribute in a user's profile parameter or in an mbox call.

  For example, you can create a "Most Popular Criteria" recommendation. From the set of returned recommendations, you can filter out any recommendations (in real time) against an attribute passed when the user accesses a page where the recommendations are displayed.

* Use static rules to limit which items are included in the recommendation (instead of using collections).

* You can create as many dynamic inclusion rules as necessary. The inclusion rules are joined with an AND operator. All rules must be met to include an item in a recommendation.

The following options are available for dynamic filtering:

|Dynamic filtering option|Details|
| --- | --- |
|[[!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching]](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/entity-attribute-matching.md)|Filter dynamically by comparing a pool of potential recommendations items to a specific item that the users have interacted with.<P>Use [!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching] when you want to show recommendations most likely to appeal to the visitor, such as the visitor's favorite brand.|
|[[!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching]](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/profile-attribute-matching.md)|Filter dynamically by comparing items (entities) against a value in the user's profile.<P>Use [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching] when you want to show recommendations that match a value stored in the visitor's profile, such as size or favorite brand.|
|[[!UICONTROL Parameter Matching]](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/parameter-matching.md)|Filter dynamically by comparing items (entities) against a value in the request (API or mbox).<P>Use [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching] to recommend content that matches the page parameters or the visitor's parameters, such as device dimensions or geo-location.|

### Filter by Value

The following option is available for filtering by value:

|Filtering by value option|Details|
| --- | --- |
|[[!UICONTROL Static Filter]](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/static-value.md)|Manually enter one or more static values to filter.|

## Available operators {#operators}

Dynamic criteria and promotions are much more powerful than static criteria and promotions and yield better results and engagement.

The following examples provide general ideas about how you can use dynamic promotions and exclusions in your marketing efforts:

>[!NOTE]
>
>"List" requires that both the entities and the profile attributes must be stored as arrays. A comma-separated list does not work.

## Handling empty values when filtering by [!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching], [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching], and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching] {#section_7D30E04116DB47BEA6FF840A3424A4C8}

You can choose several options to handle empty values when filtering by [!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching], [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching], and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching] for exit criteria and promotions.

Previously, no results were returned if a value was empty. The "If *x* is Empty" drop-down list lets you choose the appropriate action to perform if the criteria has empty values, as shown in the following illustration:

![empty_value image](assets/empty_value.png)

To select the desired action, hover over the gear icon (![icon_gear image](assets/icon_gear.png)), then choose the desired action:

| Action | Available For | Details |
|--- |--- |--- |
|[!UICONTROL Ignore this filtering rule]|[!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching] and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching]|This action is the default for [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching] and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching].<P>This option specifies that the rule is ignored. For example, if there are three filtering rules and the third rule doesn't pass any values, instead of not returning any results, you can simply ignore the third rule with the empty values.|
|[!UICONTROL Do not show any results for this criteria]<P>(Criteria only)|[!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching], [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching], and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching]|This action is the default for [!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching].<P>This action is how [!DNL Target] handled empty values before the addition of this option: no results are shown for this criteria.|
|[!UICONTROL Do not promote any items<P>(Promotions only)]|[!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching], [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching], and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching]|This action is the default for [!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching].<P>This action is how [!DNL Target] handled empty values before the addition of this option: no results are shown for this criteria.|
|[!UICONTROL Use a static value]|[!UICONTROL Entity Attribute Matching], [!UICONTROL Profile Attribute Matching], and [!UICONTROL Parameter Matching]|If a value is empty, you can choose to use a static value.|

## Caveats {#caveats}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Different data type attributes might not be compatible in dynamic criteria or promotions during runtime with the "equals" and "does not equal" operators. Use [!UICONTROL Value], [!UICONTROL Margin], [!UICONTROL Inventory], and [!UICONTROL Environment] values wisely on the right-hand side if the left hand side has predefined attributes or custom attributes.

![left_right image](assets/left_right.png)

The following table shows effective rules and rules that might not be compatible during runtime:

| Compatible Rules | Potentially Incompatible Rules |
|--- |--- |
|value - is between - 90% and 110% of current item's - salesValue|salesValue - is between - 90% and 110% of current item's - value|
|value - is between - 90% and 110% of current item's - value|clearancePrice - is between - 90% and 110% of current item's - margin|
|margin - is between - 90% and 110% of current item's - margin|storeInventory - equals - current item's - inventory|
|inventory - equals - current item's - inventory||
