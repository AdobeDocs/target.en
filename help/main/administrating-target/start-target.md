# Administrator first steps

This article contains the first steps [!DNL Adobe Target] administrators should take after receiving the emailed invitation to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].

## Get invited to [!DNL Target] {#task_3E0817630774431983FAA3D2CB2E75BD}

A system administrator in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] must add you as a user in [!DNL Target] by inviting you to join. The system administrator should then add you to one or more role-specific groups. Both of these tasks are performed in the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com).

For more information, see [Manage Experience Cloud users and products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-getting-started.html) in the *Experience Cloud and Core Services help*.

You will receive an invitation email after the system administrator has performed these steps.

## Accept the invitation {#task_24FE66659E634B24AB61DB8497772E17}

After receiving the invitation to join the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], accept the invitation, log in, and accept the [!UICONTROL End User License Agreement] (EULA).

1. Accept the invitation to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].
1. If you do not already have an Adobe ID, you are prompted to create one.

   If you have an Adobe ID, then your Adobe ID is recognized and you are prompted to sign in. 
1. Accept the [!UICONTROL Terms of Use].
1. Review the summary of what you have done so far, then click **[!UICONTROL Continue to Experience Cloud]**.
1. Sign in to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] and click **[!UICONTROL Link Account]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you do not link your account, you will not be able to access [!DNL Target].

   All [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] products appear on the linking page. Click `Link Target` and enter your [!DNL Target] username and password to access [!DNL Target]. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue to Experience Cloud]**.

   At this point, you do not yet have any groups set up with entitlements for you to link. 
1. If desired, watch the video introducing you to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].
1. To see your new privileges and access the product, sign out of [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], then sign back in.
1. Continue to the next step, [assigning yourself the Approver role](/help/main/administrating-target/start-target.md#task_15CAA437A71444E2932B333D5E66A3C7).

## Assign yourself the Approver role {#task_15CAA437A71444E2932B333D5E66A3C7}

After accepting the invitation to join the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] and logging in, confirm that [!DNL Target] has been added to your [!DNL Experience Cloud] account, then assign yourself the [!UICONTROL Approver] role for [!DNL Target].

If your organization has a [Target Standard](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#section_ACD5EFF17AAB4E979CBEFA0145CCD905) license, see [Specify roles and permissions](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md#roles-permissions) in *Users*.

If your organization has a [Target Premium](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium) license, see [Step 6: Specify roles and permissions](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/properties-overview.md#section_8C425E43E5DD4111BBFC734A2B7ABC80) in *Configure enterprise permissions*.

Your next step should be to set up users in [!DNL Target Standard] and [!DNL Target Premium]. For more information, see [User management](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/user-management.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Users with [!UICONTROL Product Admin] or [!UICONTROL System Admin] rights in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] can edit or change all settings on the [!UICONTROL Administration] page of [!DNL Target], regardless of their [!DNL Target] role. Users without [!UICONTROL Product Admin] or [!UICONTROL System Admin] rights in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] must have the specific [!DNL Target] role to make these changes.
