# Visitor profiles

Visitor profiles in [!DNL Adobe Target] contain information about how your visitors use your pages and other optimized content locations.

If [!DNL Target] is used with other [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solutions, such as [!DNL Adobe Analytics], [!DNL Experience Cloud Audiences] shares visitor information across solutions.

By default, [!DNL Target] profile information is stored in a single first-party cookie. The configuration can easily be changed to serve third-party cookies as well.

The following sections contain more information:

- [Visitor profile lifetime](visitor-profile-lifetime.md)
- [Profile attributes](profile-parameters.md)
- [Category affinity](category-affinity.md)
- [Customer attributes](working-with-customer-attributes.md)
- [Real-time profile syncing for mbox3rdPartyID](3rd-party-id.md)
- [Profile and variable glossary](variables-profiles-parameters-methods.md)
