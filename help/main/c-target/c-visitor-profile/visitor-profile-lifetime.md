# Visitor profile lifetime

By default, a visitor profile in [!DNL Adobe Target] expires after 14 days of inactivity for that visitor. This profile lifetime can be extended.

[Contact Client Care or your Adobe consultant](/help/main/cmp-resources-and-contact-information.md#reference_ACA3391A00EF467B87930A450050077C) to extend the profile lifetime at no additional cost. The lifetime can be set to as many as 90 days.

You do not need to download a new [!DNL Platform Web SDK] file or at.js file if your profile is extended beyond the default.

The expiration date is not reset for existing profiles. If a previous visitor does not return for 15 days, that profile expires. If a previous visitor returns before the original two-week profile expires, the profile is reset to the extended lifetime. All new visitor profiles are set to the extended profile lifetime.
