# Reports

Reports provide information about the progress and results of your [!DNL Adobe Target] activities that help you make decisions based on your data. Report data can help you decide when to end an activity, show you which experience of offer is the winner, and provide insights or learnings you need to determine next actions.

## Display a report {#section_C4591A32F6D04C95A1AD5A377C27C28B}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Activities]**, then click the desired activity from the list.

   If you have many activities, you can filter the list by selecting options from the [!UICONTROL Type], [!UICONTROL Status], [!UICONTROL Reporting Source], [!UICONTROL Experience Composer], [!UICONTROL Metrics Type], and [!UICONTROL Activity Source] drop-down lists.

   For example, you could select [!UICONTROL A/B Test] and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] from the [!UICONTROL Type] drop-down list and [!UICONTROL Live] from the [!UICONTROL Status] drop-down list to display only A/B tests and Experience Targeting activities that are in an active state.

   The following illustration shows the [!UICONTROL Type] drop-down list with two types selected: [!UICONTROL A/B Test] and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting]. Note that the three types of A/B Tests (Manual, [Auto-Allocate](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md), and [Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md)) are selected by default. You can deselect one or more types as needed.
