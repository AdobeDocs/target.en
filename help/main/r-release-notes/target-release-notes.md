## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 22.7.1 (July 20, 2022)

This release contains the following features, enhancements, and fixes:

|Feature|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Support for IPv6|IPv6 support is now provided in Edge delivery. A null value is returned for IPv6 (normal or dual) values.|
|A4T client-side payload handling enhancement|With A4T server-side integration, if Adobe Target identifies a request as coming from a bot, it does not forward the payload to Analytics, and there is no mod_stats event in recorded in the Target logs. Prior to this release, A4T client-side integrations would forward the payload to Analytics, even when it had been identified as bot traffic. This inconsistency between server- versus client-side would lead to discrepancies, as A4T reports for the latter included the bot traffic. Furthermore, bot traffic was not necessarily identified or flagged, meaning it was not possible to disambiguate or remove the bot traffic from the rest of the traffic. And even if a customer did account for bot traffic on their own, it would not necessarily match the set of traffic that Target identified and excluded as bot traffic, thus leading to split discrepancies or other issues. With this release, A4T client-side logging has been enhanced so that the behavior regarding the A4T payload is the same as with A4T server-side: Visitors that are identified as bots are excluded from Target counting/reporting, for both server-side and client-side implementations.|
