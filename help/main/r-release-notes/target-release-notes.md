## Target permissions update (April 22, 2025)

Effective April 22, 2025, only [!UICONTROL Product] and [!UICONTROL Solutions] admins will be able to update settings in the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections, regardless of their roles in [!DNL Target] workspaces. Users without this permission will have read-only access to the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections.
