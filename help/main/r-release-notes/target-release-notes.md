## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 25.6.4 (June 26, 2025)

This release includes the following fixes and updates:

* Added the [!UICONTROL Rearrange] option to the updated [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) UI to align with functionality available in the legacy VEC. (TGT-46957 & TGT-52876)
* Fixed an issue where modifications made to variant experiences (for example, Experience B) in an [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activity were not being retained. After switching between experiences, the changes to the variant would disappear. This issue did not affect the Control experience. (TGT-52664)
* Fixed an issue where certain customers were unable to create or save activities, while others could perform the same actions without issue. The problem was inconsistent across accounts.(TGT-52842)
* Fixed an issue where in the updated VEC, users were unable to move modifications to the [!UICONTROL Page Load event], a capability that existed in the legacy UI. (TGT-52617)
* Fixed an issue that prevented some activity modifications from displaying properly in the updated VEC. (TGT-52818)
* Fixed a null pointer exception that occurred when fetching reporting data for [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) activities. (TGT-52362)
* Fixed an issue that prevented offer-level details from appearing in the .CSV file for [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) activities. (TGT-52675)
* Fixed an issue when applying modifications in the updated VEC, changes initially appear correctly, including the expected [!UICONTROL Experience Fragment]. However, upon switching experiences or making additional edits, some modifications fail to apply due to selector issues. (TGT-52679)
* Fixed an issue where when a new activity was created by cloning an existing one, the QA links in the cloned activity incorrectly retained the page URLs from the original activity. (TGT-52775)
* Fixed an issue that unintentionally prevented [!UICONTROL On-device Decisioning] from being available in the updated VEC. (TGT-52371)
* Fixed an issue that prevented editing a product [!DNL Recommendations] activity. When attempting to access the VEC via the Target UI, an error appeared on the [!UICONTROL Overview] page, preventing any edits. (TGT-52823)
* Fixed an issue that prevented saving a [!DNL Recommendations] activity when experience names exceeded 50 characters. (TGT-52619)
* Fixed an issue where customers were unable to save a Recommendations activity after modifying the criteria in the new UI. The issue appears to be permission-related and does not affect all users with similar roles. (TGT-52816)
* Fixed an issue where users with the [!UICONTROL Editor] role were unable to edit a [!DNL Recommendations] activity. Attempting to change the design and save the activity resulted in a 403 Forbidden error, stating that the "[editor]" privilege was required, even though the user already had that role in the relevant workspace. (TGT-52836)
