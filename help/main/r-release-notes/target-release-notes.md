## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 25.8.2 (August 14, 2025)

This release includes the following fixes and updates:

**[!UICONTROL Activities]**

+++See details
* **Fixed activity-loading issue in updated [!DNL Target] UI**: Fixed an issue in the updated [!DNL Target] UI where certain activities failed to load when attempting to edit. This issue caused customers leaving users in an indefinite loading screen. This issue impacted multiple activities and was reported to occur inconsistently across customers. With this fix, affected activities now load properly, allowing seamless editing and reducing disruption to activity workflows. (TGT-53209)
* **Fixed save error in activity-create process due to `optionLocalId` validation**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process that prevented customers from saving changes due to a backend validation error: `OptionLocalIdReferentialIntegrity.ABActivity - Invalid optionLocalIds:` This issue occurred when modifying specific elements within an activity, resulting in a failed save operation. The fix ensures that `optionLocalId` references are now correctly validated, allowing customers to save activities without encountering this error. (TGT-53293)
* **Fixed crash in activity-create process caused by invalid option references when switching pages**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process that caused the UI to crash after switching pages three times during editing. The crash was triggered by invalid option references, resulting in console errors such as "Option with localId '7' not found." With this update, customers can now switch between pages and apply modifications without encountering system failures or interruptions. (TGT-53295)
* **Fixed save error in activity-create process caused by invalid user input when editing experiences**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where customers were unable to save changes to an activity due to an invalid user input error. The error occurred when modifying experiences in the updated UI, preventing updates from being committed. The activity can now be saved successfully, allowing customers to edit and publish without interruption. (TGT-53267)
* **Fixed loading issue in activity-create process that blocked editing in updated UI**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where customers were unable to edit activities in the updated UI due to a continuous loading screen. Customers can now open and modify activities without encountering loading failures. (TGT-53415)

+++

**Experience Fragments (XFs)**

+++See details
* **Fixed issue in activity-create process that allowed unintended HTML editing of AEM-exported fragments**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process that allowed customers to edit the HTML of [!DNL Experience Fragments] (XFs) exported from [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (AEM) within [!DNL Target]. This behavior was unintended, as XFs should remain locked for editing once published from AEM. The fix ensures that the "Edit HTML" option is no longer available for AEM-exported fragments, preserving content integrity and expected governance. (TGT-53286)

+++

**QA mode**

+++See details
* **Fixed issue in activity-create process where leading spaces in URLs caused broken QA links**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where leading spaces in the activity URL were not trimmed properly when saving. This caused invalid QA links and incorrect formatting in the back-end. After the update, URLs are now saved cleanly, preventing broken links and improving the reliability of QA workflows for customers. (TGT-53427)

+++

**[!UICONTROL Recommendations]**

+++See details
* **Fixed issue in catalog search UI where advanced search failed to provide suggestions**: Fixed an issue in the new [!UICONTROL Catalog Search] UI where the [!UICONTROL Advanced Search] feature failed to provide suggestions. Users were required to input exact values with precise spelling, making the search experience cumbersome and error-prone. With this fix, the [!UICONTROL Advanced Search] now offers relevant suggestions as users type, improving usability and reducing friction in locating products. (TGT-52008)
* **Resolved multiple UI and filtering issues to improve responsiveness and entity interaction**: Resolved several issues, including poor responsiveness of criteria details on small-screen devices, lack of results when selecting "All host groups" in the Environment filter, and inability to interact with entities that have no name. These fixes improve usability across screen sizes, ensure accurate filtering, and allow full interaction with all product entities, enhancing the overall experience for users. (TGT-52992)
* **Fixed missing product IDs in Recommendations detail view during activity creation**: Fixed an issue in the [!DNL Recommendations] activity-create process where product IDs were missing from the product detail screen, making it difficult for customers to copy or reference product IDs during workflows. Product IDs now appear clearly in the detail view, improving visibility and supporting more efficient product management for customers. (TGT-51964)
* **Fixed issue in activity-create process where product messages failed to display in recommendations view**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where the [!UICONTROL Message] column in the [!DNL Recommendations] view did not display product data, even though messages were present. Customers had to manually remove and re-add the column to temporarily reveal the content, which would often disappear again when scrolling or searching. This update restores consistent visibility of product messages, improving catalog navigation and review workflows. (TGT-52777)
* **Fixed issue in activity-create process where selecting 'All host groups' returned no results in recommendations view**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where selecting the "All host groups" environment in the [!DNL Recommendations] view returned no results. Customers can now view product data across all host groups as expected, improving visibility and filtering accuracy during activity setup. (TGT-53006)
* **Fixed issue in activity-create process where front-promotion toggle did not persist after saving**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where disabling the front promotion toggle in activity settings did not persist after saving. Customers attempting to remove the front promotion found the toggle re-enabled upon revisiting the activity, preventing proper customization. This update allows changes to be saved reliably, giving customers full control over promotion settings. (TGT-53215)

+++

**Visual Experience Composer (VEC)**

+++See details
* **Fixed activity loading and [!UICONTROL Cancel] button issues in activity-create process**: Fixed an issue in the activity-create process where certain activities failed to load, leaving customers unable to access modifications. Additionally, the [!UICONTROL Cancel] button was unresponsive, preventing customers from stopping the loading process or exiting the edit view. This fix ensures that activities now load reliably and the [!UICONTROL Cancel] button functions as expected, improving overall stability and user experience in the Visual Experience Composer. (VEC)(TGT-53218)
* **Fixed experience switching issue in updated VEC UI that blocked editing and disabled [!UICONTROL Cancel] button**: Fixed an issue in the updated VEC UI where modifications failed to load when switching between experiences in an Experience Targeting (XT) activity. Customers were unable to edit experiences beyond the one they initially entered, and the [!UICONTROL Cancel] button was either missing or unresponsive. This fix ensures that modifications now load correctly across all experiences and that the [!UICONTROL Cancel] button functions reliably, even without the Helper extension, improving editing workflows and reducing frustration. (TGT-53256)
* **Fixed white screen issue when switching between multiple experiences in activity-create process**: Fixed an issue where switching between multiple experiences caused a white screen. Also fixed an issue in the activity-create process where customers encountered a white screen when attempting to modify multiple experiences within an activity. This issue occurred after applying changes to two experiences and then selecting a third experience, preventing further edits. The update ensures smooth transitions between experiences, allowing customers to make modifications without interruption. (TGT-53266)
* **Fixed issue in VEC where custom code changes were not reliably saved across editing sessions**: Fixed an issue where custom code modifications made in the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) were not reliably saved in a single attempt. Customers reported that changes, such as styling updates or HTML edit, were intermittently missing from the website and QA URLs, even after using both the [!UICONTROL Edit Content] and final [!UICONTROL Save] buttons. This regression has been resolved, ensuring that all custom code changes persist as expected across editing sessions.** (TGT-53418)
