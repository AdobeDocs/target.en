## [!DNL Target] Standard/Premium 23.9.3 (September 18, 2023)

This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:

* Enhanced the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) to support Lightning DOM (Web Components). (TGT-45422)
* Fixed an issue that caused VEC actions to be applied in the incorrect order. In some cases, the VEC applied some modifications asynchronously and adding extra modifications to an element caused errors if that element displays after an [!UICONTROL Insert] action. (TGT-45983)
* Fixed an issue with the VEC [!UICONTROL Overlay] feature to support elements in Shadow DOMs. (TGT-46217)
* Fixed an issue when opening a Single Page Application (SPA) page in the VEC and then going to Browse mode caused the Back and Forward arrows to not function correctly. (TGT-45956)
* Fixed an issue that caused some web pages to fail when loading in the VEC.
