## Target permissions update (April 22, 2025)

This future update enhances organizational control over [!DNL Target] instance configurations, preventing accidental updates that could affect activity delivery across various testing and personalization teams.

Effective April 22, 2025, only [!UICONTROL Product] and [!UICONTROL Solutions] admins will be able to update settings in the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections, regardless of their roles in [!DNL Target] workspaces. Users without this permission will have read-only access to the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections.

For more information, see [Administer Target](/help/main/administrating-target/start-target.md).

## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 25.4.3 (April 10, 2025)

This release includes the following fixes and updates:

* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL Activity QA] link in the [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] incorrectly redirected to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] homepage. (TGT-52055)
* Added an error message to guide users on resolving duplicate options in an activity. (TGT-51927)
* Fixed an issue where additional pages added to the [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activity were not retained after saving and reopening. (TGT-51994)
* Fixed an issue that prevented customers from deleting styles in the inline style section. (TGT-52070)
* Restored access to [audience definition cards](/help/main/c-target/c-audiences/audiences.md#section_11B9C4A777E14D36BA1E925021945780) in the [!UICONTROL Activity QA] dialog box, similar to the legacy UI. (TGT-52056)
* The updated UI did not save pages or audiences without modifications. If customers added new pages or audiences to an activity but make no changes to them, [!DNL Target] discarded the unmodified audiences upon saving. Notifications have added in relevant places to inform users of this behavior. (TGT-52104)

## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 24.10.2 (October 21, 2024)

This release contains the following fixes:

* Fixed an issue that prevented [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities from loading in [!UICONTROL Compose] and [!UICONTROL Browse] modes. (TGT-50709)
* Fixed an issue with the new [[!DNL Google Chrome] [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Helper] extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md) that caused a redirect from the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) to the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] after clicking Cancel. Before this fix, customers needed to refresh the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] before being able to create new activities. (TGT-49980)-->
