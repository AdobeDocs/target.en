|[!UICONTROL Auto-Target] using [!UICONTROL Analytics for Target] (A4T)|Updated tutorial:<ul><li>[Setting up A4T reports in [!DNL Analysis Workspace] for [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] activities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target-learn/tutorials/integrations/set-up-a4t-reports-in-analysis-workspace-for-auto-target-activities.html){target=_blank}</li></ul>|

* Enhanced audience and activity synchronization so that items created in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager] are available in the [!DNL Target] UI quicker. (TGT-44568)
* Made change to allow users to remove the [!UICONTROL Default URL] under [!UICONTROL Administration] > [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] > [!UICONTROL Default URL]. This change lets customers change the default URL back to an empty string, which was previously not possible after initial configuration. (TGT-44577)
* Removed restrictions that prevented customers from editing or deleting out-of-the box audiences (audiences with reserved names). (TGT-44655)
* Disabled the "[!UICONTROL Done]" option while loading spinners were visible in the [!DNL Target] UI when creating [combined audiences](/help/main/c-target/combining-multiple-audiences.md). (TGT-44079)
* Fixed the [!UICONTROL Language] link at the bottom of the [!UICONTROL Audiences] page so that it correctly links to the "[!UICONTROL Account communication preferences]" page. (TGT-43562)
* Resolved an issue that sometimes prevented customers from creating [!UICONTROL A/B Test] activities after selecting the [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics] option under [!UICONTROL Administration] > [!UICONTROL Reporting] > [!UICONTROL Reporting Experience Cloud Solution]. (TGT-44844)
* Fixed an issue that prevented customers from viewing the last experience in a [!UICONTROL Multivariate Test] activity with many experiences from within the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC). The [DOM path](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/viztarget-options.md#dom-path) at the bottom of the VEC sometimes prevented customers from seeing the last experience. (TGT-44578)
* Fixed an issue that caused the Browse URL in the VEC to not reflect the current page that is visible in a normal browser session if the page requires authorization or invokes redirects. (TGT-44350)
* Fixed an issue that prevented customers from changing the [!UICONTROL Filter Incompatible Criteria] setting in [!UICONTROL Recommendations] > [!UICONTROL Settings]. (TGT-44398)
* Fixed an issue that caused POST requests to create new [!DNL Recommendations] feeds to fail when using [!UICONTROL Analytics Classifications] with report suites with dots in their names. (TGT-44598)
* Updated links in the [!DNL Target] UI to point to the new [Visual Editing Helper extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md). (TGT-44459)
* Enhanced security to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attempts in [!DNL Recommendations] feeds. (TGT-43769)
* Fixed an issue that prevented customers from viewing preview images in [!DNL Recommendations] designs if the image name contains [GB18030 characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030){target=_blank}. (TGT-44614)
* Fixed an issue that caused some [GB18030 characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030){target=_blank} to be escaped in the [!UICONTROL Modifications] panel while editing [!UICONTROL Text/HTML] on an activity's [!UICONTROL Experiences] page. (TGT-44600)
