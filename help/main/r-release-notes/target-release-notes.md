## [!UICONTROL Activities] page user interface refresh (October 25, 2023)

As part of the [!DNL Adobe Target] team's ongoing effort to improve the user-experience for [!DNL Target] users, this release refreshes the [!UICONTROL Activities] page in the [!DNL Target] UI. This update unifies and standardizes design patterns that were previously inconsistent, while adding new enhancements.

Starting Wednesday, October 25, a percentage of customers will have access to the new UI with additional customers getting access in the next several days.

## [!DNL Target] Standard/Premium 23.10.2 (October 24, 2023)

* Updated various localized strings in the Target UI. (TGT-18899)
