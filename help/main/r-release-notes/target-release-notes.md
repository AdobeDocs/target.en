## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 25.2.1 (February 17, 2025)

This release includes the following updates:

### [!UICONTROL Activities] user interface update

As the [!DNL Adobe Target] UI modernization effort continues, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the updated [!UICONTROL Activities] User Interface.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Starting February 17, customers will gradually have access to the new [!UICONTROL Activities]  UI. To ensure a seamless rollout for all customers, this release will be deployed in controlled stages. The first stage will upgrade the initial group of [!DNL Target] customers to the new [!UICONTROL Activities] UI. Subsequent stages will upgrade the remaining customers.

Based on the latest [!DNL Adobe Spectrum] design system, the update standardizes previously inconsistent design patterns, while adding new enhancements, such as:

* [Redesigned reporting](/help/main/administrating-target/reporting.md) for better insights into activity results.
* [[!UICONTROL Updated Change Log]](/help/main/c-activities/change-log.md) page, now getting the information from the [[!DNL Audit Query API]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/landing/governance-privacy-security/audit-logs/audit-api/overview){target=_blank} for real-time insights.
* [Customizable list views](/help/main/c-activities/activities.md) to for better flexibility across different team needs.
* [Enhanced quick info and detail screens](/help/main/c-activities/activities.md) for easier access to information.
* [Session-persistent search and filter options](/help/main/c-activities/activities.md).
* Completely [rebuilt [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Composer]](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md) with support for latest security updates from browser providers and a modern user interface.

  For information about how the updated VEC differs from the previous version, see:
  
  * [Visual Experience Composer changes](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/vec-changes.md) 
  * [Visual Experience Composer options](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/viztarget-options.md)

>[!NOTE]

## [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] `__view__` scope optimization (October 22, 2024)

Between July 22, 2024 and August 15, 2024, the [!DNL Target] team optimized the `__view__` scope, enhancing the accuracy of activity impression, visit, and visitor reporting. This optimization aims to automatically capture reporting data for auto-rendered propositions and should be transparent to most accounts.

All new [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] customers will have this optimization enabled. However, customers who migrated from at.js and have not followed the implementation steps below have the optimization disabled. We urge these customers to review their implementations by February 3, 2025. After this date, we will enable the optimization for all customers. Failure to review and adjust implementations by then might impact reports, as mentioned below. Please contact [!DNL Adobe Customer Care] if you need to confirm whether your implementation is affected or if you require more time to adjust your implementation.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you cannot complete your implementation review and resolve any issues by February 3, 2025, you can request a one-time, six-month extension. Ensure that your request is submitted by January 31, 2025. Adobe will review and decide on your request.

To benefit from this optimization in case of manual proposition rendering, review your [[!DNL Platform Web SDK implementation]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/target-dev/developer/client-side/aep-web-sdk){target=_blank} to ensure that you are sending notifications after manually rendering experiences or when using the `applyPropositions` method (or the corresponding [!DNL Launch] action as a helper) to render experiences.

The most-common scenarios when experiences are manually rendered include:

* Using JSON offers
* Using a custom decision scope in an activity created in the [[!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer]](/help/main/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md)
* Not using `renderDecisions: true` when fetching an activity created using the [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] that uses the global `__view__` scope

If notifications are not implemented as documented in [Render personalized content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/personalization/rendering-personalization-content){target=_blank} in the *Data Collection* guide, reporting data might be missing in [!DNL Target] and in [Analytics for Target reporting](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/a4t/a4t.md) (A4T). In certain scenarios, you might notice an incorrect traffic split because the reporting data is not captured. Or, in other scenarios, reporting the same event repeatedly.

Depending on your implementation, check for [!DNL Analytics] and A4T reporting impacts. 

The [!DNL Platform Web SDK] supports two implementation types for rendering experiences and personalizations:

* **Single call for personalization and measurement.**

  Initially recommended, the single-call approach for the [!DNL Platform Web SDK] is scheduled to be deprecated in favor of the split-call approach. Adobe advises all new implementations to use the new split-call approach and recommends that existing customers transition to the split-call method as well. 
  
  If you continue to use the single-call approach, you might notice the following unexpected changes in your [!DNL Analytics] reports:

  * A dip in bounces.
  * A4T and [!UICONTROL Page View] hits not stitched together, making it challenging to perform certain breakdowns and correlations of your A4T reports using [!DNL Analytics] eVars and events.

* **Split calls (also known as top and bottom of page events).**

  This implementation type is the new [split-call implementation approach](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/use-cases/top-bottom-page-events){target=_blank} recommended by [!DNL Adobe]. With this approach, the new optimization does not impact [!DNL Analytics] or A4T reports.

If you have questions, contact [Adobe Customer Care](/help/main/cmp-resources-and-contact-information.md##reference_ACA3391A00EF467B87930A450050077C). (KB-2179)

<!-- 
## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 24.10.2 (October 21, 2024)

This release contains the following fixes:

* Fixed an issue that prevented [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities from loading in [!UICONTROL Compose] and [!UICONTROL Browse] modes. (TGT-50709)
* Fixed an issue with the new [[!DNL Google Chrome] [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Helper] extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md) that caused a redirect from the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) to the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] after clicking Cancel. Before this fix, customers needed to refresh the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] before being able to create new activities. (TGT-49980)-->
