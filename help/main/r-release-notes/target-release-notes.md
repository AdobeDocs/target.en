# Target release notes (prerelease)

This article contains prerelease information. Release dates, features, and other information are subject to change without notice. 

**Last Updated: April 21, 2022**

To view information about the current release, see [Target Release Notes](release-notes.md). The information on these pages could be the same, depending on the timing of releases. The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.

## [!DNL Target] platform release (April 27, 2022)

This release contains the following change:

* With this release you can prefetch content for [!UICONTROL Auto Personalization] (AP) and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] (AT) activities (previously not returned by [!DNL Target]). This might change the experiences the end users see in case of a pre-fetch call (no changes to the "execute" flow) if an AP/AT activity is on the delivery path and is higher in priority than other AB/XT activities that use the same location for content delivery.

## [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 22.4.1 (April 28, 2022)

This release contains the following fix:

* Fixed an issue that caused three cart-based algorithms to use the same Bought/Bought condition on the [!DNL Target] backend. (TGT-43456)
