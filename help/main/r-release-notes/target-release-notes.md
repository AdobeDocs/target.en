This release contains the following fixes:

* Fixed an issue that prevented [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities from loading in [!UICONTROL Compose] and [!UICONTROL Browse] modes. (TGT-50709)
* Fixed an issue with the new [[!DNL Google Chrome] [!UICONTROL Visual Editing Helper] extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md) that caused a redirect from the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) to the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] after clicking Cancel. Before this fix, customers needed to refresh the [!UICONTROL Activities Library] before being able to create new activities. (TGT-49980)
