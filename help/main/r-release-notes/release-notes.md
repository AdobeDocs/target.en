# [!DNL Target] release notes (current)

These release notes provide information about features, enhancements, and fixes for each [!DNL Adobe Target Standard] and [!DNL Target Premium] release. In addition, release notes for [!DNL Target] APIs, SDKs, the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK], at.js, and other platform changes are also included, when applicable.

(The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.)

## [!DNL Target] Standard/Premium 23.9.3 (September 18, 2023)

This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:

* Enhanced the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) to support Lightning Web Components (Light DOM). (TGT-45422)
* Fixed an issue that caused VEC actions to be applied in the incorrect order. In some cases, the VEC applied some modifications asynchronously and adding extra modifications to an element caused errors if that element displays after an [!UICONTROL Insert] action. Also fixes the VEC URL that now updates when clicking anchor links. (TGT-45983)
* Fixed an issue with the VEC [!UICONTROL Overlay] feature, which now supports elements in Shadow DOMs. (TGT-45202 & TGT-45262)
* Fixed an issue when opening a Single Page Application (SPA) page in the VEC and then going to [!UICONTROL Browse] mode caused the Back and Forward arrows to not function correctly. (TGT-45956)
* Fixed an issue that prevented some web pages from loading in the VEC. (TGT-45983)

* Fixed issues that impacted [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) activities for some customers, including timely syncing the activity on the [!DNL Target] backend and delivering the expected experience in preview links. (TGT-46202)

* Increased the timeout for PUT calls to the Target Delivery API to 15 seconds to avoid timeout errors. (TGT-46091)
