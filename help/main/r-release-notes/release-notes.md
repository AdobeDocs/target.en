## [!DNL Target] platform release (July 20, 2022)

This release contains the following features, enhancements, and fixes:

|Feature|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Improved audience evaluation accuracy and reduced end-user latency through IPv6 support (TNT-43364, TNT-44692) |Visitors' geo-locations are now determined by IPv6 addresses, if available, as opposed to only IPv4 addresses. Delivery APIs also support IPv6 input parameters. Filtering and allow-listing support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 support in this release means visitors will be more accurately included in audiences (more accurately qualify for activities or be included in filtering criteria). It also improves data latency, as IPv6 clients will route directly, avoiding the overhead of the the IPv6-to-IPv4 gateway.|
|Fixed A4T client-side payload handling issue (TNT-44926)|With A4T server-side integration, if Adobe Target identifies a request as coming from a bot, it does not forward the payload to Analytics, and there is no mod_stats event in recorded in the [!DNL Target] logs. With this release, A4T client-side logging has been enhanced so that the behavior regarding the A4T payload is the same as with A4T server-side: Visitors that are identified as bots are excluded from [!DNL Target] counting/reporting. (Note the issue in question was limited to implementations that used client-side payload handling; server-side was not impacted. With this release, the behavior is now consistent for both server-side and client-side payload handling.)|
