# [!DNL Target] release notes (current)

These release notes provide information about features, enhancements, and fixes for each [!DNL Adobe Target Standard] and [!DNL Target Premium] release. In addition, release notes for [!DNL Target] APIs, SDKs, the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK], at.js, and other platform changes are also included, when applicable.

(The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.)

## Target permissions update (April 22, 2025)

This future update enhances organizational control over [!DNL Target] instance configurations, preventing accidental updates that could affect activity delivery across various testing and personalization teams.

Effective April 22, 2025, only [!UICONTROL Product] and [!UICONTROL Solutions] admins will be able to update settings in the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections, regardless of their roles in [!DNL Target] workspaces. Users without this permission will have read-only access to the [!UICONTROL Administration] sections.

For more information, see [Administer Target](/help/main/administrating-target/start-target.md).
