## [!UICONTROL Activities] page user interface refresh (October 25, 2023)

As part of the [!DNL Adobe Target] team's ongoing effort to improve the user-experience for [!DNL Target] users, this release refreshes the [!UICONTROL Activities] pages in the [!DNL Target] UI. This update unifies and standardizes design patterns that were previously inconsistent, while adding new enhancements.

Starting Wednesday, October 25, a percentage of customers will have access to the new UI with additional customers getting access in the next several days.

For more information see [Activities](/help/main/c-activities/activities.md).

## [!DNL Target] Standard/Premium 23.10.2 (October 24, 2023)

* Enhanced the new [!UICONTROL Activities] UI so that the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) opens with the default settings for `selectorCriteria` when creating a new activity. (TGT-46586)
* Fixed an issue that prevented some customers from editing elements in [!UICONTROL Composer] mode when using the VEC. (TGT-46470)

* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented an [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] report that uses [!UICONTROL Analytics for Target] (A4T) from displaying in the [!DNL Target] UI, even though the report displayed correctly in [!DNL Adobe Analysis Workspace]. (TGT-46494)
* Updated various localized strings in the Target UI. (TGT-18899)
