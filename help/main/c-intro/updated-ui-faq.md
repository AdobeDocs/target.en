# [!DNL Target] UI update FAQs

New in 2025, the [!DNL Adobe Target] redesigned user interface offers a cleaner, more intuitive experience for all users. This FAQ covers key updates to the [!DNL Target] UI and [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC), including navigation changes, feature placements, and the removal of the temporary UI toggle. Whether you're a marketer, developer, or admin, it's your guide to a smooth transition and smarter workflows.

## Has the timeline for the deprecation of the Target UI version toggle been updated?

+++See details
The [!DNL Target] team is offering a temporary feature that lets you switch between the updated [!DNL Target] UI and the legacy version using a toggle button. This option is available only during the final phase of the UI rollout.

Once the rollout is complete, the toggle will be removed, and all users transition permanently to the updated UI. [!DNL Adobe] recommends planning ahead, as this feature will be phased out soon.

### Deprecation timeline

Due to recent issues identified, primarily related to complex customer customizations, the [!DNL Target] team has adjusted the deprecation timeline:

* **June 17, 2025**: All IMS Organizations have been enabled for the updated [!DNL Target] UI, either for specific users or organization-wide, to begin testing the new experience.

* **June 30, 2025**: The [updated [!DNL Target] UI](/help/main/c-intro/understand-the-target-ui.md) became the default experience for all IMS Orgs that have enabled the UI version toggle.

  * Customers who currently see the legacy UI, by default, now see the updated UI upon login.
  * The UI version toggle remains available through the end of July, allowing users to switch back if needed.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > [!DNL Adobe] strongly recommends using the updated [!DNL Target] UI. Switch back to the legacy UI only if a blocker issue occurs, due to [limitations of the toggle switch behavior](#limitations).

* **July 15 to July 30, 2025**: The UI version toggle will be permanently disabled in phases. Affected IMS Orgs are no longer able to revert to the legacy UI.
  
  * Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
  * Delays to the toggle deprecation are granted only briefly (a few days) while blocker issues are resolved.

Contact [Adobe Customer Care](/help/main/cmp-resources-and-contact-information.md#/help/main/cmp-resources-and-contact-information.md) with any concerns or if you anticipate issues during this transition.

### Limitations of the UI toggle behavior {#limitations}

The following information describes the limitations that you should be aware of when choosing to use the version toggle:

* **Visibility of new activities**: Activities created in the updated UI will not be visible if you switch back to the legacy UI.
* **Editing existing activities**: Changes made to existing activities (originally created in the legacy UI) while using the updated UI are published to your website. However, these updates are not visible in the legacy UI if you switch back; only the last updates made from the legacy UI appear there.
* **Consistency of activity details**: The most recent changes, regardless of which UI you use, are reflected on your live website. However, the legacy UI only shows the latest changes made from within that version. This situation might cause confusion if activities edited in the updated UI look different than what you see in the legacy UI.

## Can customers apply for the UI version toggle to remain for their accounts if they prefer to stay with the legacy UI?

+++Details
The UI version toggle is a temporary feature that lets you switch between the updated [!DNL Target] UI and the legacy version using a toggle button. This option is available only during the final phase of the UI rollout. Once the rollout is complete, the toggle will be removed, and all users will transition permanently to the updated UI.

## How does the updated VEC handle the rearrange, resize, move, hide, and remove options and how do these options differ from the legacy VEC? {#options}

+++Details
**[!UICONTROL Rearrange*]*: In the legacy VEC, the rearrange option used an overlay to let users reposition an element within its sibling group. Movement was limited to changing the order among sibling elements.

  In the updated VEC, this functionality is streamlined through move forward and move backward actions. These controls adjust an element's position in the layout—both horizontally and vertically—by shifting it forward or backward in the stacking order.

**Resize**: The [!UICONTROL Resize] feature is located in the [!UICONTROL Properties] panel under the [!UICONTROL Size] section. Users can adjust an element's width and height directly. Advanced settings include:

  * Min/Max Width & Height controls
  * Overflow behavior settings.
  * Object Fit options for media elements

  These tools provide precise control over element dimensions and layout behavior.

**Move**: The [!UICONTROL Move] option is found in the [!UICONTROL Properties] panel under the [!UICONTROL Position] section. This option enables users to:

  * Set the element's position (for example, absolute, relative, fixed)
  * Define the z-index for layering
  * Choose a positioning type

  The updated [!UICONTROL Properties] rail also supports custom inline styles, offering flexibility when preset options don't meet layout needs.

**[!UICONTROL Hide]**: The [!UICONTROL Hide] feature is located in the [!UICONTROL Properties] panel. After selecting an element, click [!UICONTROL Hide Element] to remove it from view without deleting it. This is useful for managing visibility during design or preview.

**[!UICONTROL Remove]**: The [!UICONTROL Remove] feature is accessible via the [!UICONTROL Properties] panel. After selecting an element, click Remove Element to delete it from the page. This action permanently removes the element from the layout.

## Can I collapse the [!UICONTROL Components], [!UICONTROL Modifications], and [!UICONTROL Properties] rails so that I can enlarge the [!UICONTROL Design] panel? {#collapse}

+++Details

Yes, you can collapse these rails to let you expand the [!UICONTROL Design] canvas to make editing easier. Here's how:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Show Components] icon ( ![Show Components icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Add.svg) ) and the [!UICONTROL Show Modifications] icon ( ![Show Modifications rail](/help/main/assets/icons/History.svg) ) act as toggles to show the appropriate options.

**Collapse the [!UICONTROL Components] rail**

To collapse the [!UICONTROL Components] rail and enlarge the [!UICONTROL Design] canvas, while the [!UICONTROL Components] rail is open, click the ( ![Show Components icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Add.svg) ) icon.

**Collapse the [!UICONTROL Modifications] rail**

To collapse the [!UICONTROL Modifications] rail and enlarge the [!UICONTROL Design] canvas, while the [!UICONTROL Modifications] rail is open, click the [!UICONTROL Show Modifications] icon ( ![Show Modifications rail](/help/main/assets/icons/History.svg) ) icon.

**Collapse the [!UICONTROL Properties] rail**

To collapse the [!UICONTROL Properties] rail and enlarge the [!UICONTROL Design] canvas, click the [!UICONTROL Show/Hide Properties] icon ( ![Properties icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Propertie.svg) ) to the right of the rail to collapse or display the [!UICONTROL Properties] rail.

+++

## Are the [!UICONTROL Save as Draft] and [!UICONTROL Syncing] states still available?

+++Details
With the latest updates to the user interface, the [!UICONTROL Save as Draft] and [!UICONTROL Syncing] states are no longer available. For more information, see Statuses under [Apply filters to the Activities list](/help/main/c-activities/activities.md#filters) in *[!UICONTROL Activities overview]*.

+++

## How can I tell if an activity was created or edited in the legacy UI or in the updated UI?

+++Details
Activities created or edited in the updated UI follow the same guided, three-step workflow and might include UI-specific metadata or formatting not present in legacy-created activities. Although there's no visible tag or label in the interface, differences in layout, structure, or available options (such as enhanced targeting or preview features) can indicate which UI was used. For detailed identification, check the activity's change history or consult your implementation logs.

+++

## What are the differences between creating offers in the legacy versus the updated UI? Are additional attributes required?

+++Details
The [!UICONTROL Offer Library] UI requires consistent attribute definitions for all offers. When creating an activity-only (ad-hoc) offer, users must also specify an offer name. This information appears in the [!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer], making it easier to identify offers without reviewing the code or content.

+++

## What happened to the offer preview links in the updated UI?

+++Details
[!UICONTROL Experience Fragment] preview links are available in the [!UICONTROL Quick Info] popover, displayed when clicking the information icon ( ![Info icon](/help/main/assets/icons/InfoOutline.svg) ) corresponding to the selected fragment.

+++

## I have to disable the [!UICONTROL Enhanced Experience Composer] when editing existing activities with the updated UI. Has [!DNL Adobe] observed similar behavior with other customers?

+++Details
Yes. When using the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] [!DNL Visual Editing Helper extension], you might need to disable the [!UICONTROL Enhanced Experience Composer] (EEC) . 

For more information, see [Visual Editing Helper extension](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/visual-editing-helper-extension.md).

+++

## Can you point me the details of the new IPs for allowlisting? 

+++Details
For more information about IP addresses that you can allowlist, see the following articles:

* **Enhanced Experience Composer (EEC)**: See [The EEC won't load an internal QA URL that is not accessible on public IP](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/troubleshooting-issues-related-to-the-enhanced-experience-composer-eec.md#section_D29E96911D5C401889B5EACE267F13CF) in *Troubleshooting issues related to the Enhanced Experience Composer*
* **[!UICONTROL Recommendations]**: See [IP addresses used by Recommendations feed-processing servers](/help/main/c-recommendations/c-recommendations-faq/ip-addresses-marketing-cloud.md).

+++

## Does the environment reset to staging by default on the new Recommendations UI?

+++Details
Environments now default to the last one used by the customer. To switch environments, use the [!UICONTROL Environment] selector in the upper-right corner of the [!UICONTROL Catalog Search] UI.

![Environment switch](/help/main/c-intro/assets/environmnent.png)

## How complex is it to connect [!DNL Adobe Analytics] or [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics] to [!DNL Target]?

+++Details
Integrating [!DNL Adobe Analytics] (AA) or [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics] (CJA) with [!DNL Target] can range from moderate to advanced effort, depending on your current setup. If you're using [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and have implemented the [!DNL Platform Web SDK], the integration is more streamlined. However, legacy implementations using at.js or AppMeasurement may require additional configuration, including:

* Enable the [Analytics for Target (A4T) integration](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/a4t/a4t.md)
* Integrate [[!DNL Target] reporting in [!DNL Adobe Customer Journey Analytics]](/help/main/c-integrating-target-with-mac/cja/target-reporting-in-cja.md).
* Map report suites and data views
* Ensure consistent identity resolution (ECID)
* Validate data collection and attribution settings
