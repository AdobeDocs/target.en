## Target Premium {#premium}

[!BADGE Premium]{type=Positive}

[!DNL Target Premium] is an advanced [!DNL Target] offering that requires a license to add premium features to [!DNL Target Standard].

All [!DNL Target Premium] articles in Target guides include the Premium badge at the top of each page or inline near the affected text. The Premium badge is clickable and includes a link to this section.

[!DNL Target Premium] includes the following features: 

### Automated Personalization

[Automated Personalization](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/automated-personalization.md#task_8AAF837796D74CF893CA2F88BA1491C9) (AP) provides advanced machine learning algorithms to drive personalized experiences and improved conversion rates for digital experiences.

[!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] records visitor activity on the site, building a profile of visitors so content can be targeted to similar visitors. AP tracks responses to content, both for individuals and for the population as a whole. AP then uses sophisticated modeling approaches to automatically target each individual. AP considers everything known about each visitor.

[!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] learns by itself and requires minimum human analysis. Fully automated, AP learns continuously. The system builds models and automatically learns which products an individual visitor is most likely to be interested in. Every time a visitor interacts with the site, information is collected and stored in that visitor's profile. Multiple algorithms are available to provide the best model for your system.

### Auto-Target

[Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md) uses advanced machine learning to identify multiple high-performing marketer-defined experiences. [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] then serves the most tailored experience to each visitor. Delivery is based on individual customer profiles and the behavior of previous visitors with similar profiles. [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] helps personalize content and drive conversions.

### Recommendations 

[Recommendations](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations.md#concept_7556C8A4543942F2A77B13A29339C0C0) activities automatically display products or content that might interest your customers based on previous user activity. [!UICONTROL Recommendations] help direct customers to relevant items they might otherwise not know about.

A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a customer, depending on that customer's activities on the site. For example:

* Encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles.

  Create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" criteria.

* Increase the time visitors spend on your media site by recommending similar video content to what they are currently watching.

  Create a recommendation that suggests other videos, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" criteria.

* Suggest that customers who viewed information about savings plans at your bank also read about IRA accounts.

  Show other products people purchased after viewing one product without showing the first product in the recommendations, using the "people who viewed this also bought" criteria.

### Recommendations as an offer

[Recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md) lets you include recommendations inside [!UICONTROL A/B Test], [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], [!UICONTROL Auto-Target], and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities. 

This functionality opens up entirely new capabilities, such as:

* Test and target recommendations and non-recommendations content within the same activity.
* Easily experiment with placement of recommendations on the page, including the order of multiple recommendations.
* Automatically push traffic to the best-performing recommendations experience using [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate].
* Dynamically assign visitors to tailored recommendations experiences based on individual profiles using [!UICONTROL Auto-Target].

### Enterprise User Permissions

[Enterprise User Permissions](/help/main/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md#concept_E396B16FA2024ADBA27BC056138F9838) functionality lets you create different projects (called "Product Profiles" in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console for Enterprise]). [!UICONTROL Enterprise User Permissions] let you assign different permissions for a single user that dictate that user's access rights for each project. These distinct projects can be compared to the way that report suites work in [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. Each project can have specific users with specific roles that apply to a set of properties. The result is that customers are able to restrict the view, edit, approval, and publish access to their users. You can restrict users based on region, environment (dev/stage/prod), channel, or other custom criteria.
