# ![PREMIUM](/help/main/assets/premium.png) Data used by [!DNL Target] machine-learning algorithms

[!DNL Adobe Target] automatically collects and uses a variety of data to build its personalization algorithms in [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] (AT) activities. When a visitor enters an AP or AT activity, a snapshot of information is passed to a set of "training records" (the visitor data that the personalization algorithms will learn on).

To learn more about the [!DNL Target] personalization algorithms, see [Random Forest Algorithm](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/algo-random-forest.md).

## Default [!DNL Adobe Target] attribute categories

The following table shows the data collected by [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] activities by default, without any configuration of [!DNL Target] or other [!DNL Adobe] solutions, as well as the naming convention used to indicate these attributes in [Personalization Insights Reports](/help/main/c-reports/c-personalization-insights-reports/personalization-insights-reports.md#concept_A897070E1EDC403EB84CFB7A6ECAD767). You can augment the input data set at any time. To learn more about how to upload additional data, see [Uploading data for the [!DNL Target] personalization algorithms](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/uploading-data-for-the-target-personalization-algorithms.md).

## Blocking features from [!DNL Target] machine-learning algorithms

Features can be blocked from [!DNL Target] machine-learning algorithms, preventing them from being used in any [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] or [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] model or activity. 

For more information, see [Models API (Blocklisting) Overview](https://developer-stage.adobe.com/target/before-administer/models-api/){target=_blank} in the *Adobe Target Developer Guide*.
