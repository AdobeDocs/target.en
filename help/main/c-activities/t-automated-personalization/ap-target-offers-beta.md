# Target [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] offers

In an [!DNL Adobe Target] [!DNL Automated Personalization] (AP) activity, you can target offers to specific audiences.

Using this functionality reduces the number of offers a specific visitor is qualified to see. For example, consider an [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activity that has three offers. Offer 1 has a targeting rule that limits its exposure to Audience A. Two visitors saw this activity.

| | Visitor 1 | Visitor 2 |
|--- |--- |--- |
|Audience qualification|Audience A|Audience B|
|Offer 1 Target personalization model score|90|90|
|Offer 2 Target personalization model score|50|70|
|Offer 3 Target personalization model score|80|60|

In this scenario, Visitor 1 sees Offer 1 (because this visitor qualifies as part of Audience A), which is that visitor's highest score. However, Visitor 2 sees Offer 2 even though the highest score is for Offer 1, because Visitor 2 is not part of Audience A. This example demonstrates why targeting rules should be used sparingly to meet business needs. Adding these rules can reduce the effectiveness of [!DNL Target] personalization models.

## Set up targeting rules 

1. Create or edit an [Automated Personalization activity](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/create-ap-activity.md) containing the offers that you want to target.
1. After setting up the offers for the activity in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer], click the **[!UICONTROL Manage Content]** icon ( ![Manage Content icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Experience.svg) ).

   The [!UICONTROL Manage Content] dialog box displays.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** tab.

1. Select the desired offers, then choose the audiences you want to qualify to see that offer.

   To set up targeting for a single offer, click the More Info ( ![More Info icon](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreSmallList.svg) ) icon next to the desired offer, then click **[!UICONTROL Target Audience]** to display the [!UICONTROL Add Audiences] dialog box.

   To set up targeting for multiple offers, select the checkboxes for the desired offers, then click the **[!UICONTROL Target Audience]** link that displays at the bottom of the list.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Add Audiences] dialog box, select the desired audiences for the offers, then click **[!UICONTROL Assign Audience]** to return to the [!UICONTROL Manage Content] dialog box.

For more information, see [Combining Multiple Audiences](/help/main/c-target/combining-multiple-audiences.md#concept_A7386F1EA4394BD2AB72399C225981E5).
