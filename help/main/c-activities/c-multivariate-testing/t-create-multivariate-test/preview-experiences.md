# Preview experiences for a [!UICONTROL Multivariate Test]

Because a [!UICONTROL Multivariate Test] in [!DNL Adobe Target] compares multiple experiences on a page, it is helpful to preview the page with each experience.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**, then click the **[!UICONTROL Show Experiences]** icon ( ![Show Experiences icon](/help/main/assets/icons/WebPages.svg) ) to display the list of all experiences in the left frame.

1. Click a specific experience in the list to view that experience.

1. (Conditional) To exclude one or more experiences from the activity, click the **[!UICONTROL Manage Content]** icon ( ![Manage Content icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Experience.svg) ) to display the [!UICONTROL Manage Content] dialog box.

1. (Conditional) In the [!UICONTROL Manage Content] dialog box, click the **[!UICONTROL More Actions]** icon ( ![More Actions icon](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreSmallList.svg) ) next to the experience that you want to exclude, then click **[!UICONTROL Exclude]**.

   You might choose to exclude an experience that shows conflicting variations or an experience that is not aesthetically balanced.

1. (Conditional) To exclude multiple experiences, select the check boxes for the desired experiences, then click **[!UICONTROL Exclude]**.

1. (Conditional) To include multiple experiences that have been excluded, select the check boxes for the desired experiences, then click **[!UICONTROL Include]**.

>[!NOTE]

>When creating multivariate tests, you can exclude more than 10 percent of experiences from the test, provided you acknowledge the warning that you must then use offline reporting for analysis.
