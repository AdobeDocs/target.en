# Activities overview

Personalize content and test page designs for specific audiences with [!DNL Adobe Target] activities.

For example, you might design an activity that tests two different landing pages, one that highlights information about women's summer shoes, and another landing page that highlights more general summer apparel. The activity determines the conditions that control when each of these landing pages displays, and the metrics that determine which page is more successful. The activity is configured to start and end when specific conditions are met, such as between specific dates. Or you can choose to start when the activity is approved and to end when it is deactivated.

When designing an activity, you should plan carefully. Determine when the activity starts and how long it lasts. Then, list your offers and assign a target audience to each one.

## Activities list {#section_DE8E2DB30D534962A931EF8BB48240F5}

The [!UICONTROL Activities] list is the default view when you open [!DNL Target]. You can create activities from this page and manage existing activities.

You can also display the [!UICONTROL Activities] list by clicking the [!UICONTROL Activities] tab at the top of the [!DNL Target] UI.

![Activities list](/help/main/c-activities/assets/activities-list-new.png)

## Activity types {#types}

[!DNL Target] includes several activity types. The following table provides an overview of each activity type with links to help you learn more. To help you better choose the best activity type for your purposes, use the [Adobe Target Activities Guide](/help/main/c-activities/target-activities-guide.md).

| Activity Type | Description |
|--- |--- |
|[[!UICONTROL A/B Test]](/help/main/c-activities/t-test-ab/test-ab.md)|A/B testing compares two or more versions of your website content to see which version best improves your conversions during a pre-specified test period.|
|[[!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate]](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md)|[!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], a type of A/B test, identifies a winner among two or more experiences and automatically reallocates more traffic to the winner to increase conversions while the test continues to run and learn.|
|[[!UICONTROL Auto-Target]](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md)<P>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|Auto-Target, a type of A/B test, uses advanced machine learning to identify multiple high performing marketer-defined experiences, and serves the most tailored experience to each visitor based on the individual customer's profile and the behavior of previous visitors with similar profiles, to personalize content and drive conversions.|
|[[!UICONTROL Multivariate Test]](/help/main/c-activities/c-multivariate-testing/multivariate-testing.md)|[!UICONTROL Multivariate Testing] (MVT) compares combinations of offers in elements on a page to determine which combination performs the best for a specific audience, and identifies which element most impacts the activity's success.|
|[[!UICONTROL Experience Targeting]](/help/main/c-activities/t-experience-target/experience-target.md)|[!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) delivers content to a specific audience based on a set of marketer-defined rules and criteria.|
|[[!UICONTROL Automated Personalization]](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/automated-personalization.md)<P>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|[!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) combines offers or messages, and uses advanced machine learning to match different variations to each visitor based on their individual customer profile, to personalize content and drive conversions.|
|[[!UICONTROL Recommendations]](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations.md)<P>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a website visitor, depending on that visitor's activities on the site.<P>For example, you might want to encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles. You could create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" algorithm. Or, you might want to encourage visitors to spend more time on your media site by recommending similar videos to the video they are watching, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" algorithm.<P>**NOTE**: You can also include recommendations inside [!UICONTROL A/B Test], [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], [!UICONTROL Auto-Target], and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities. For more information, see [Recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). This functionality requires that you have a [Target Premium license](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium).|

## Perform quick actions {#quick-actions}

Click the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** icon ( ![More actions menu](/help/main/assets/icons/MoreVertical.svg) ) next to each activity name to open a menu that lets you perform quick actions on an activity.

The following actions are available (depending on your permissions and the activity status):

|Action|Description|
| --- | --- |
|[!UICONTROL Edit]|Change the activity. Any activity can be edited.<P>For more information about the various ways you can edit activities, see [Edit an activity or save as draft](/help/main/c-activities/edit-activity.md).|
|[!UICONTROL Deactivate]|Stop a live or scheduled activity. A deactivated activity can be reactivated or archived.<P>If you deactivate or archive an activity and then later reactivate it, a visitor will continue being a part of that activity after the reactivation if they were in it before it was deactivated or archived. Any conversion metrics recorded during the time between the two events won't be attributed to that activity.|
|[!UICONTROL Activate]|Start an inactive activity or an activity that is ready to be activated.|
|[!UICONTROL Archive]|Send the activity to the archive. By default, archived activities no longer appear in the [!UICONTROL Activities] list. Change the filter for the [!UICONTROL Activities] list to include archived activities to see them. You can activate an archived activity to use it again.<P>If you deactivate or archive an activity and then later reactivate it, a visitor will continue being a part of that activity after the reactivation if they were in that activity before it was deactivated or archived. Any conversion metrics recorded during the time between the two events won't be attributed to that activity.|
|[!UICONTROL Copy]|Copy an activity. Any activity can be copied. Copying an activity creates a new activity with the same name, appended with "Copy." For example, a test called "Browser Offers" is copied to "Browser Offers Copy."<P>Visual offers are copied with the activity. You can safely edit the offers in the copy without impacting the original activity. The only exception is saved offers and images in the Content/Assets folder.|
|[!UICONTROL Delete]|Delete a draft or activity.<P>**NOTE**: Deleted activities cannot be recovered. Unless you are sure that you'll never need this activity again, use the [!UICONTROL Archive] action. You can then reactivate the activity if necessary.|

## Considerations

Note the following details about the [!UICONTROL Activity] list:

* [!UICONTROL Archived] and [!UICONTROL Ended] activities do not appear in the [!UICONTROL Activities] list. To view these activities, filter them using the [Filters icon](#filters) ( ![Show Filters icon](/help/main/assets/icons/Filter.svg) ) at the top of the list. 
* When an activity originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] is deactivated or deleted, it is deleted from [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. Deleted activities originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] are not sent to the [!UICONTROL Archive] folder in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. The archived folder functionality applies only to activities created in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. 
* All activity types other than [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP), [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] give you the choice to use either [!DNL Target] or [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as the data source. [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization], [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] *always* use [!DNL Target] data. 
* Activities are available to several channels:

    * Web and mobile sites 
    * Internet-connected screens and devices, including kiosks and ATMs 
    * Email and other acquisition channels or partner sites 
    * Mobile apps 
    * Anywhere else you can deliver tagged content

## Limitations {#section_049D4684403A4E07B998067EB8E9BE56}

Each [!DNL Target] activity has the following content limitations:

| Item | Limit |
|--- |--- |
|Unique selectors|300 if a selector is repeated in a different experience, it is counted once. However, if it is repeated in the same experience, it is counted again.|
|Offers in each experience|350|
|Click track selectors in metrics|50|
|Mboxes in metrics|50|
|Audiences and locations|50 audiences and locations (mbox) combinations should not be more than 50.|

The activity cannot be saved if you exceed any of these limits.

Increasing the numbers of these items in your activity also increases the length of time that it takes to synchronize the activity across [!DNL Target].

For additional limits of the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC), see [Visual Experience Composer Limitations](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/experience-composer-best-practices.md#section_F33C2EA27F2E417AA036BC199DD6C721).

## Attributes imported into [!DNL Target] for activities updated outside of [!DNL Target] {#section_802B0D174E6A44E1A96F404CA81AAE44}

If activities created in [!DNL Target] are updated from outside of [!DNL Target] (for example, via API), the following activity attributes are imported back into [!DNL Target]: `thirdpartyId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `status`, `priority`, and `marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)`.

This import job runs when the [!UICONTROL Activities] list is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes.
