# Activities

Activities in [!DNL Adobe Target] let you personalize content to specific audiences and test page designs.

For example, you might design an activity that tests two different landing pages, one that highlights information about women's summer shoes, and another landing page that highlights more general summer apparel. The activity determines the conditions that control when each of these landing pages appears, and the metrics that determine which page is more successful. The activity is configured to start and end when specific conditions are met, such as between specific dates, or to start when the activity is approved and to end when it is deactivated.

When designing an activity, you should plan carefully. Determine when the activity will start and how long it will last. Then, list your offers and assign a target audience to each one.

## Activity types {#types}

[!DNL Target] includes several activity types. The following table provides an overview of each activity type with links to help you learn more. To help you better choose the best activity type for your purposes, we have also created the [Adobe Target Activities Guide](/help/main/c-activities/target-activities-guide.md).

| Activity Type | Description |
|--- |--- |
|[A/B Test](/help/main/c-activities/t-test-ab/test-ab.md)|A/B testing compares two or more versions of your website content to see which version best improves your conversions during a pre-specified test period.<br>**Note:** You can now include [recommendations inside A/B Test activities](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). This functionality requires that you have a [Target Premium license](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium).|
|[Auto-Allocate](/help/main/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md)|[!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], a type of A/B test, identifies a winner among two or more experiences and automatically reallocates more traffic to the winner to increase conversions while the test continues to run and learn.<br>**Note:** You can now include [recommendations inside Auto-Allocate activities](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). This functionality requires that you have a [Target Premium license](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium).|
|[Auto-Target](/help/main/c-activities/auto-target/auto-target-to-optimize.md)<br>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|Auto-Target, a type of A/B test, uses advanced machine learning to identify multiple high performing marketer-defined experiences, and serves the most tailored experience to each visitor based on their individual customer profile and the behavior of previous visitors with similar profiles, in order to personalize content and drive conversions.<br>**Note:** You can now include [recommendations inside Auto-Target activities](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). This functionality requires that you have a [Target Premium license](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium).|
|[Multivariate Test](/help/main/c-activities/c-multivariate-testing/multivariate-testing.md)|[!UICONTROL Multivariate Testing] (MVT) compares combinations of offers in elements on a page to determine which combination performs the best for a specific audience, and identifies which element most impacts the activity's success.|
|[Experience Targeting](/help/main/c-activities/t-experience-target/experience-target.md)|[!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) delivers content to a specific audience based on a set of marketer-defined rules and criteria.<br>**Note:** You can now include [recommendations inside Experience Targeting activities](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md). This functionality requires that you have a [Target Premium license](/help/main/c-intro/intro.md#premium).|
|[Automated Personalization](/help/main/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/automated-personalization.md)<br>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|[!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) combines offers or messages, and uses advanced machine learning to match different variations to each visitor based on their individual customer profile, in order to personalize content and drive conversions.|
|[Recommendations](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations.md)<br>![Target Premium](/help/main/assets/premium.png)|A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a website visitor, depending on that visitor's activities on the site.<br>For example, you might want to encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles. You could create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" algorithm. Or, you might want to encourage visitors to spend more time on your media site by recommending similar videos to the video they are watching, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" algorithm.<br>**Note:** You can now include recommendations inside A/B Test (including [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target]) and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities. See [Recommendations as an offer](/help/main/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md).|

|Activate|Start an inactive or ready activity.|
|Archive|Send the activity to the archive. By default, archived activities no longer appear in the Activities list. Change the filter for the activities list to include archived activities to see them.

Note the following details about the Activity list:

* Archived and ended activities do not appear in the [!UICONTROL Activities] list. To view these activities, filter them using the advanced filter settings on left rail. 
* As soon as an activity originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] is deactivated or deleted, it is deleted from [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. Deleted activities originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] are not sent to the [!UICONTROL Archive] folder in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. The archived folder functionality applies only to activities created in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. 
* All activity types other than [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP), [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] give you the choice to use either [!DNL Target] or [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as the data source. [!UICONTROL AP], [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] *always* use [!DNL Target] data. 
* Activities are available to several channels:

    * Web and mobile sites 
    * Internet-connected screens and devices, including kiosks and ATMs 
    * Email and other acquisition channels or partner sites 
    * Mobile apps 
    * Anywhere else you can deliver tagged content

## Limitations {#section_049D4684403A4E07B998067EB8E9BE56}

Each Target activity has the following content limitations:

| Item | Limit |
|--- |--- |
|Unique selectors|300 if a selector is repeated in a different experience, it is counted once. However, if it is repeated in the same experience, it is counted again.|
|Offers in each experience|350|
|Click track selectors in metrics|50|
|Mboxes in metrics|50|
|Audiences and locations|50 Audiences and locations (mbox) combination should not be more than 50.|

The activity cannot be saved if you exceed any of these limits.

Increasing the numbers of these items in your activity also increases the length of time it takes to synchronize the activity across Target.

For additional limits of the Visual Experience Composer, see [Visual Experience Composer Limitations](/help/main/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/experience-composer-best-practices.md#section_F33C2EA27F2E417AA036BC199DD6C721).

## Attributes imported into [!DNL Target] for activities updated outside of [!DNL Target] {#section_802B0D174E6A44E1A96F404CA81AAE44}

If activities created in [!DNL Target] are updated from outside of [!DNL Target] (for example, via Adobe I/O), the following activity attributes are imported back into [!DNL Target]:

`thirdpartyId`

`startDate`

`endDate`

`status`

`priority`

`marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)`

This import job will run when the activities page is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes. (KB-1526)
