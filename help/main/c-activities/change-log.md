# Activity change log

The [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Change Log] records activity actions, including what changed, who made the changes, and when they occurred. The [!UICONTROL Change Log] page is populated from the [[!UICONTROL Audi Query API]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/landing/governance-privacy-security/audit-logs/audit-api/overview){target=_blank} for real-time insights.

To access the [!UICONTROL Change Log] page: 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Activities]** > click the desired activity from the list.
1. Cick **[!UICONTROL Change Log]** in the left rail.

The action performed, the date the action was performed, and the user who performed the action are listed any time an activity is created, updated, activated, or deactivated. Changes to custom targets and offers used in the activity are also listed.

Refresh the page to see status changes. You can also list the actions performed in ascending or descending order by clicking the [!UICONTROL Date] column header.
